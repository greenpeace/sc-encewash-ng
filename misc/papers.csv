To offset this increased pressure on water resources, the environmental performance of livestock sector should continue to improve. Over the last few decades, product output per animal and feedstuff yields in the US have improved, but before now it was unclear to what extent these improvements influenced the water productivity (WP) of the livestock products. In this research, we estimate changes in WP of animal products from 1960 to 2016. We consider feed conversion ratios (dry matter intake per head divided by product output per head), feed composition per animal category, and estimated the water footprint of livestock production following the Water Footprint Network's Water Footprint Assessment methodology. The current WP of all livestock products appears to be much better than in 1960. The observed improvements in WPs are due to a number of factors, including increases in livestock productivity, feed conversion ratios and feed crop yields, the latter one reducing the water footprint of feed inputs. Monogastric animals (poultry and swine) have a high feed-use efficiency compared to ruminants (cattle), but ruminants consume relatively large portion of feed that is non-edible for humans. Per unit of energy content, milk has the largest WP followed by chicken and pork. Per gram of protein, poultry products (chicken meat, egg and turkey meat) have the largest WP, followed by cattle milk and pork. Beef has the smallest WP. These data provide important information that may aid the development of strategies to improve WP of the livestock sector. Gerber, 2010; Thornton, 2010). Livestock products supply about 12.9% of calories and 27.9% of protein consumed globally (Gerber et al., 2013). Unless proper policies targeting production systems and consumption trends are put in place, the growth in the livestock sector could put further pressure on already strained natural resources such as freshwater and land, and aggravate land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Various studies have highlighted the environmental impacts of the livestock sector including water consumption and pollution (","Acknowledgements

case of livestock products. Setting benchmarks, estimating the WP gaps, and identifying the critical factors are potential future areas of research.The increase of WP of livestock products is mostly in the hands of livestock farmers, who choose breeds and determine feed composition and sourcing, and feed crop farmers, who can increase the WP in feed production by soil mulching and applying better agricultural practices that result in higher yields at the same or less water consumption. Governments can play a role by providing incentives or regulations to stimulate certain choices and practices and discourage others. A particular role for government is to promote the use of crop residuals and byproducts as feed rather than primary crops.

We expect transition dynamics in the food processing sector to differ from the typical dynamics portrayed in transitions literature due to particularities in required technological knowledge and government intervention. To better understand dynamics in the food processing sector we apply the Technological Innovations Systems (TIS) framework to an in-depth case study of the plant-based meat substitutes industry in the Netherlands. Results illustrate that, contrary to many other transitions, consumers and changing informal institutions are the driving forces of this process. We show how strengthening cognitive and normative legitimacy can lead to growing markets for sustainable products.","Acknowledgement

Production of animal-based proteins includes limitations, including time, energy and cost as well as environmental consideration. Therefore, replacement of meat by alternative ingredients can be a useful approach. Microbial proteins, especially mycoproteins, can substitute partially or entirely animal-based protein foods such as meats. Use of agroindustrial wastes for the production of mycoproteins is a multiple target, especially from environmental aspects. Mycoproteins are healthy sources of essential amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins and carotenes. Furthermore, mycoproteins can be produced with low total costs, independent to climates (such as flood or drought) and landscape limitations. The aim of this study was to review characteristics of mycoproteins as meat alternatives. After a short insight into sensory attributes and consumer acceptances of the mycoprotein products, use and formulation of mycoproteinss as meat substitutes were reviewed. Then, environmental, economic and marketing aspects of this idea were discussed. Moreover, health and safety aspects (e.g. contradictory reports) were studies, including reports on effects of mycoprotein consumption on total blood cholesterol and LDL and HDL cholesterols as well as the impact their effects on satiety, glycemic response, foodborne pathogens, allergy and waste use. in this study, ethical and halal concerns were reviewed as well.","Acknowledgment

New approaches for meat waste conversion to products are needed. In this work, we developed a pulsed electric fieldbased process for functional chemicals extraction from waste chicken breast muscle. We show that a two-step protocol, which consists from high voltage, short pulses followed by low voltage long pulses, with the total invested energy of 38.4 ± 1.2 J g À1 , of initial waste meat, enables extraction of 12 ± 2% of the initial waste chicken biomass to the liquid fraction. The protein content of the extract fraction was 78 ± 8 mg mL À1. In silico analysis also suggested that the extracted proteins could have antioxidant properties. This was corroborated experimentally with DPPH and ABTS assays. Process parameters analysis with Taguchi methodology showed that long pulse duration played the most important role in liquid extraction from the waste chicken breast muscle, followed by short pulses duration, number of long and short pulses. Our study suggests that pulsed electric fields combined with mechanical pressing can be used for extraction of functional molecules from the waste meat biomass using non-thermal, chemical-free process. Such a strategy could provide an additional income and thus, stimulate farmers and meat processors to reduce waste and waste-related environmental pollution.","Acknowledgments

To this end, a multi-dimensional analysis model was developed to determine the working area that provides optimal combustion process conditions. The input parameters consisted of the waste stream, exhaust gas oxygen concentration, and heat flux recovered as saturated steam. The limiting parameters of the MBM combustion process, such as the temperature of the exhaust gas after the post-combustion chamber, the temperature of the exhaust gas before the bag filter, and the exhaust gas residence time in the post-combustion chamber, constituted the output parameters. The results of the multi-dimensional analysis were visualized in terms of the distribution of the output parameter values obtained from the input parameter function. Based on a comparison of every output parameter to its corresponding limit value, optimal working areas of the thermal waste treatment system were defined. The research reveals that it is possible to determine the MBM combustion optimal working area that complies with all of the conditions and restrictions. It is worth understanding this working area during the design and construction of thermal waste treatment systems. The multi-dimensional analysis model has been verified under industrial conditions at a real MBM combustion facility.","Acknowledgements

The United Nations 2030 Agenda has established food waste as a global concern, contributing to social, environmental and economic losses. Nevertheless, only a few studies have addressed food waste quantification from production to consumption stage. This paper, in line with Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/1597 concerning a common methodology and minimum quality requirements for the uniform measurement of levels of food waste, applies the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) methodology to the Italian meat industry, testing its reliability in sustainability assessments. With MFA it was possible first to quantify and qualify food waste streams and secondly to calculate related material cycles and ecoefficiency indicators. Results demonstrate that, in 2018, the Italian meat industry processed more than 4.9 Mt to produce approximately 2.0 Mt of fresh meat, 1.9 Mt of co-products and by-products, 0.7e0.8 Mt of meat-based products and more than 0.2e0.3 Mt of food waste at retail and final consumption. Material Use Efficiency was estimated at 0.95e0.97 (96%) at slaughtering, drastically decreasing to 0.79e0.85 (82%) when ""unconscious"" food waste was included, showing that it represents a significant variable mass for material cycle indicator calculation. On the other side, a sharp increase in eco-efficiency indicators was assessed, showing an average variation of approximately þ20% in the last ten years in terms of material input productivity.","acknowledgement

The extrusion of plant-based proteins can be performed by two technologies: high moisture extrudates (HME) and low moisture texturized vegetable proteins (TVP). The largest difference between the technologies relates to the moisture content prevailing inside the extrusion barrel. The extrusion processes also vary in their throughput, and yields. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to compare the environmental performance of the two extrusion technologies applied to two plant-based raw materials (soymeal and pumpkin seed flour). Additionally, the study compared plant-based burger patties to meat burger patties (beef, pork and chicken). The impact of plant-based burger patties was at least tenfold lower than meat burger patties. TVP-production exhibited a higher environmental impact compared to HME (20e40% higher depending on the raw material).

This limitation is a barrier to more sustainable production and consumption of animal products. In this study, we combine life cycle thinking with an environmental justice approach to map Costco's beef supply chain in California and to explore the environmental burden of air pollution (PM 2.5) due to beef production in the San Joaquin Valley, a region that has some of the worst air quality in the United States. To map the supply chain of one of Costco's primary suppliers, Harris Ranch, and the feedlots they operate, the study uses a methodological framework known as Tracking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST). Our modeling revealed that feedlots produce~95% of total PM 2.5 emissions across the beef supply chain, and they alone account for approximately 1/3 of total anthropogenic PM 2.5 emissions in the Valley. PM 2.5 concentrations are markedly higher around these facilities. The spatial analysis revealed that communities living near feedlots are often poor, predominantly Latinx and have increased PM 2.5 related disease burdens, including asthma, heart disease and low weight birth. Based on company documents and news reports, neither Costco nor Harris Ranch are addressing this environmental injustice. Documenting the geographically specific impacts of livestock production opens up opportunities for corporations to address environmental injustices in their supply chains through more sustainable sourcing and production practices, and for consumers to rethink their consumption of meat.","Acknowledgements

Results showed that C. protothecoides, S. obliquus and C. vulgaris and their consortia presented robust growth in synthesized wastewater. Acclimated S. obliquus, C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana adapted better to the environment in wastewater and achieved significantly (P < 0.05) higher biomass than those without acclimatization. At the end of the nine-day-treatment period, S. obliquus and its consortium with C. vulgaris achieved the highest biomass accumulation (1.7 g/L). However, cultivation periods longer than five days did not significantly (P > 0.05) improve the microalgal removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients under conditions evaluated in this study. Results showed that 74% total phosphate (TP-PO 4 3-), 52% total nitrogen (TN) and 87% COD were removed from wastewater after five-day microalgae treatment, which was higher than the removal observed in control samples (48% TP-PO 4 3-, 32%TN, 84% COD). Microalgae treatment did not improve COD removal but was able to accelerate the removal rate. A consortium containing three species (S. obliquus þ C. vulgaris þ C. sorokiniana) was assessed to improve nutrients and COD removal. The consortium achieved higher removal of COD (91%), TN (67%) and TP-PO 4 3-(69%). Therefore, the acclimated consortium of S. obliquus þ C. vulgaris þ C. sorokiniana can be effectively used in the treatment of heavily polluted meat processing wastewater as primary or secondary treatment option.","Acknowledgements

The main goal of this paper was to assess the potential impact of the reduction in red meat consumption on the carbon footprint of Canadian livestock production. Beef, pork and broilers were used to represent Canadian carcass based food commodities. Three scenarios for allowable red meat (beef and pork) consumption were tested based on medical recommendations of 15.9, 23.7 and 27.6 kg (boneless weight) per capita per year. Maintaining national dietary protein intake at 0.39 Mt was the main boundary condition for the projected reduction of red meat. A spreadsheet model was used to interpolate published Greenhouse Gas emission estimates from 1981 to 2006 for beef, pork and broiler production to 2017. This model accounted for the life cycles, age-gender categories, and supporting crop complexes of each livestock type. Three production scenarios based on two different apportionments of allowable red meat to beef and pork, and two alternative beef diets, were combined with the three medical scenarios to formulate nine projected consumption recommendations. These projections generated the slaughter animal live weights, Greenhouse Gas emissions from their production, and their protein contents. All nine scenarios required a major expansion of broiler production to satisfy the required national protein intake. The amounts by which the nine scenarios reduced Greenhouse Gas emissions ranged from 0% to 31% of the 32.6 Mt of total national CO 2 e emissions for the production of these three commodities in 2017.","Acknowledgements

We performed an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) of a 100 g serving of cooked protein balls (PPBs) made from peas (Pisum sativum), and Swedish-style beef meatballs (MBs) made from Irish or Brazilian beef. Per serving, PPB production and consumption was associated with lower environmental burdens across all 16 categories assessed. Global warming, acidification, and land use burdens of PPBs were at least 85%, 81%, and 89% smaller, respectively, than MBs. The scale of environmental advantage was sensitive to the allocation method, with biophysical allocation across cattle co-products decreasing MB burdens by at least 35%, 38%, and 46% in the acidification, climate change, and land use categories, respectively. Furthermore, PPBs have a higher nutritional density than MBs, and hence their environmental footprint per unit of nutrition was considerably lower across all 16 impact categories. Per Nutrient Density Unit, global warming, acidification, and land use burdens of PPBs were at least 89%, 87%, and 93% smaller, respectively, than MBs. Results were tested with Monte Carlo simulations and a modified null hypothesis significance test, which supported the main findings. Finally, when COC of land was factored in, the climate advantage of PPBs extended greatly. Assuming MBs equivalent to just 5% of German beef consumption are replaced by PPBs, total carbon savings including COC could amount to 8 million tonnes CO 2 e annually, an amount equal to 1% of Germany's annual GHG emissions. Therefore, this study highlights the potential of PPBs to meet health and climate neutrality objectives.","Acknowledgements

Therefore, in the present study to evaluate the life cycle assessment of the applied up-flow anaerobic, anoxic, oxic bioreactor, the direct-practical data were collected and utilized with the aim to promote knowledge in respect of the possible damages of meat processing wastewater treatment plants for the environment. Accordingly, the CML-IA baseline 2000 and ReCiPe Midpoint (H) methods were chosen because of more reliable and comprehensive information which those presented. Generally, the results demonstrated that the bioreactor was an environmentally friendly system to treat meat processing wastewater. The evaluation of eutrophication potential manifested that phosphate contribution was more than 60% for ReCiPe Midpoint (H) and 99.8% for CML-IA baseline 2000, respectively. In addition, the estimation of cumulative energy demand revealed 70 MJ energy consumption belongs to the electricity generation which can be saved by controlling temperature, aeration, and the system leak. Conclusively, the obtained findings illustrate an integrated wastewater management policy to assist managers for investment decisions.","Acknowledgment

This calls for new strategies to change dietary habits, especially as many consumers are reluctant to eat less meat. This study tests the effect of labelling a meat-based ready meal with different levels of carbon footprint and healthiness on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for these attributes. Participants took part in two sequential non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments (DCE). In the first experiment, they completed a DCE where the ready meals (i.e. beef lasagne) were labelled using a dual traffic light labelling system; one labelled for carbon footprint and one for healthiness. In the second experiment, participants repeated the DCE after they were told the carbon footprint and healthiness varied because of the meat and saturated fat content, respectively. The study found that participants were willing to pay a premium for the healthier lasagne and this did not change when they were given the information about saturated fat content. Participants were also willing to pay a premium for lasagne with a lower carbon footprint, but this decreased when they knew these meals contained less meat. Information about the meat content had the unintended consequence of discouraging people to buy lasagne with a low carbon footprint. The study provides an important insight for policy and industry into the effect of labelling information on consumers' purchasing decisions at a time when people are being encouraged to eat less meat.","Acknowledgments

Meat products are excellent matrices for introducing different bioactive compounds, to obtain functional meat products aimed at minimizing the pro-oxidant effects associated with high meat consumption. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the concept and preparation of healthy and functional meat, which could benefit antioxidant status. Likewise, the key strategies regarding meat production and storage as well as ingredients used (e.g., minerals, polyphenols, fatty acids, walnuts) for developing these functional meats are detailed. Although most effort has been made to reduce the oxidation status of meat, newly emerging approaches also aim to improve the oxidation status of consumers of meat products. Thus, we will delve into the relation between functional meats and their health effects on consumers. In this review, animal trials and intervention studies are discussed, ascertaining the extent of functional meat products' properties (e.g., neutralizing reactive oxygen species formation and increasing the antioxidant response). The effects of functional meat products in the frame of diet-gene interactions are analyzed to 1) discover target subjects that would benefit from their consumption, and 2) understand the molecular mechanisms that ensure precision in the prevention and treatment of diseases, where high oxidative stress takes place. Long-term intervention-controlled studies, testing different types and amounts of functional meat, are also necessary to ascertain their positive impact on degenerative diseases.","Acknowledgments

We hypothesized that higher TRM intake would negatively influence glycemic control and inflammation based on positive correlations between TRM and diabetes. We found 24 eligible articles (median duration, 8 weeks) from 1172 articles searched in PubMed, Cochrane, and CINAHL up to August 2019 that included 1) diet periods differing in TRM; 2) participants aged ≥19 years; 3) included either men or women who were not pregnant/lactating; 4) no diagnosed cardiometabolic disease; and 5) data on fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), or cytokines. We used 1) a repeated-measures ANOVA to assess pre to post diet period changes; 2) random-effects meta-analyses to compare pre to post changes between diet periods with ≥ vs. <0.5 servings (35g)/day of TRM; and 3) meta-regressions for dose-response relationships. We grouped diet periods to explore heterogeneity sources, including risk of bias, using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Quality Assessment of Controlled Interventions Studies. Glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR values decreased, while HbA1c and CRP values did not change during TRM or alternative diet periods. There was no difference in change values between diet periods with ≥ vs. <0.5 servings/day of TRM [weighted mean differences (95% CIs): glucose, 0.040 mmol/L (−0.049, 0.129); insulin, −0.710 pmol/L (−6.582, 5.162); HOMA-IR, 0.110 (−0.072, 0.293); CRP, 2.424 nmol/L (−1.460, 6.309)] and no dose response relationships (P > 0.2). Risk of bias (85% of studies were fair to good) did not influence results. Total red meat consumption, for up to 16 weeks, does not affect changes in biomarkers of glycemic control or inflammation for adults free of, but at risk for, cardiometabolic disease.

A total of 1020 CAT and 776 DESCR were identified from 369 articles that assessed muscle food consumption and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, or cancer in adults ≥19 y from PubMed, Cochrane, and CINAHL up to March 2018. Specificity of CAT was analyzed on an empirical 1-7 ordinal scale as: 1) broad/undescriptive, ""fish""; 2) muscle food type, ""red meat""; 3) species, ""poultry""; 4) broad + 1 descriptor, ""processed meat""; 5) type/species + 1 descriptor, ""fresh red meat""; 6) broad/type + 2 descriptors, ""poached lean fish""; and 7) specific product, ""luncheon meat."" Median CAT specificity for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OBSs) was 2 and 3 points out of 7, respectively, with no differences between chronic disease types. Specificity of OBS CAT was higher in recent articles but RCT CAT became less specific starting in the 2000s. RCT CAT were 400% more likely to include species, 500% more likely to include leanness, but 400% less likely to include processing degree compared with OBS CAT. A DESCR was included for 76% and 82% of OBS and RCT CAT, respectively. Researchers described processed meat, red meat, and total meat CAT more commonly than poultry or fish CAT. Among processed meat DESCR, 31% included a common term used in public regulatory definitions. In conclusion, muscle food categories and descriptions are substantively different within and between experimental and observational studies and do not match regulatory definitions. A practical muscle food classification system is warranted to improve interpretation of evidence regarding muscle food consumption and chronic disease.","Acknowledgments

Interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour are generally acceptable approaches to promote dietary change, but little is known about their effectiveness to reduce the demand for meat. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the demand for meat. Methods: We searched six electronic databases on the 31st of August 2017 with a predefined algorithm, screened publicly accessible resources, contacted authors, and conducted forward and backward reference searches. Eligible studies employed experimental designs to evaluate interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the consumption, purchase, or selection of meat in comparison to a control condition, a baseline period, or relative to other eligible interventions. We synthesised results narratively and conducted an exploratory crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify combinations of intervention characteristics associated with significant reductions in the demand for meat. Results: We included 24 papers reporting on 59 interventions and 25,477 observations. Self-monitoring interventions and individual lifestyle counselling led to, or were associated with reduced meat consumption. Providing information about the health or environmental consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume and select meat in virtual environments, but there was no evidence to suggest this approach influenced actual behaviour. Education about the animal welfare consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume meat, while interventions implicitly highlighting animal suffering were not. Education on multiple consequences of eating meat led to mixed results. Tailored education was not found to reduce actual or intended meat consumption, though few studies assessed this approach.","Acknowledgements

Methods: Healthy males were recruited to participate in a 12-week inpatient study and were randomized to a weight-maintaining dietary intervention that contained varying combinations of meat (0% or 19%), fish (0% or 6%), or soda (0% or 14%) in a factorial design. Macronutrient composition across dietary intervention groups was as follows: 50% of energy from carbohydrates, 30% of energy from fat, and 20% of energy from protein. Whole-room indirect calorimetry at baseline and week 12 were used to measure 24hrEE and substrate oxidation. Results: Twenty-six males (mean [SEM], age: 46.6 [10.4] years; BMI: 26.9 [4.1] kg/m 2) completed all measurements. Fish consumption resulted in higher 24hrEE by 126 (55) kcal/d compared with no fish consumption (P = 0.03), whereas 24hrEE for soda consumption was 132 (56) kcal/d (P = 0.03) lower. Approximately 80% of the decrease in 24hrEE with soda consumption was due to lower awake-inactive energy expenditure (EE; P = 0.001). No specific EE component accounted for the differences observed with fish consumption. Conclusions: The data indicate that dietary sources of protein and carbohydrates appear to influence 24hrEE and inactive EE.","Acknowledgments

The answers can be influenced by multiple factors. We explore the influence of the patient's nutritional status on some of the responses. Methods: A satisfaction survey of the diet is offered to hospitalized patients who are on a regulardiet. These patients are selected because it is a non-therapeutic diet and therefore its quality does not depend on the underlying pathology. General assessment, presentation, variety, quantity and temperature are requested. In addition, nutritional assessment was performed with MNA-SF, calf circumference, triceps skinfold, arm circumference, weight loss, hand strength and bioelectrical impedance. Chi square and ANOVA are assessed. Informed consent is requested. Results: 1) Of the 654 hospitalized patients, 132 patients (20.18%) (57.6% men, mean age 66.9 +15 years) were on a regular diet. 56.8% are from medical areas and 43.2% from surgical areas. The average number of days admitted was 10.93 ± 12.9. 2) The good or very good valuation in general is 71.4%, presentation 85.7%, variety 81.7%, temperature 84%, but consider that the amount was too much 50%. 3) They recognize that 35.4% eat half or less of the ration and according to MNA-SF, 2.4% are malnourished and 29.7% are at risk of malnutrition. 4) Patients who reported that the quantity offered was too much, 40.8% are at risk of malnutrition and 5.3% are malnourished. 5) Comparison between those who consider that the amount of food is too much compared to those who consider it adequate, those who report that it is too much are older (p: 0.0001), lower calf circumference (p: 0.01), worse score in MNA (p: 0.01) and lower strength of the hand (p: 0.0001). 6) The muscle mass measured by bioimpedance was lower in the group that considered that the quantity of the food offered was too much but without statistical significance. Conclusions: The regular diet is well considered in the hospital and a high percentage of hospitalized patients consider that the quantity offered is excessive, but they are the oldest and worst nourished so it should not consider reducing the food rations offered.",

For its early diagnosis the evaluation of the psoas using the CT scan proved to be an effective method. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study was performed with patients undergoing gastrointestinal tract surgery at a state public hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, where the presence of sarcopenia was evaluated. From the analysis of transversal computed tomography images, the tissues around the third lumbar vertebra were differentiated and separated based on the specific density of each; the area of the psoas muscle was then calculated by the measurements of its greatest transverse and longitudinal diameters. Through the predictive equations developed by Mourtzakis and colleagues (2008) the coefficient was calculated in order to predict patients' muscle mass and to identify those sarcopenic. Cutoff points for sarcopenia are <385 mm2 for women and <545 for men. Results: The sample for the composition of this study was 52 patients, with a mean age of 61.3 years (± 12.89), being excluded 4 patients that were not quantified the coefficients. Of which 52.08% were considered sarcopenic. Conclusions: The method proved to be effective for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, allowing the definition of the most appropriate therapeutic plan to be performed.",

However, little literature reported the association among people with obesity versus those without obesity. We sought to investigate this using the UK Biobank data. Methods: In this large prospective population-based cohort study, the red and processed meat consumption was assessed through the UK Biobank touch-screen questionnaire at baseline. The estimated hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between red and processed meat consumption and the risk of CV death, cerebrovascular, and ischemic heart diseases in participants with and without obesity. Results: Of 428,070 participants, 100,175 (23.4%) were obese with the mean age of 56 (SD: 7.9) years old and 54% were female. Participants without obesity, the mean age was 56 (SD: 5.2) years old and 55% were female. The overall median follow-up was 7.2 (IQR: 6.5e7.8) years. red and processed meat consumption had increased risk of CV death (HR (95%CI):1.04 (1.01e1.08) per week serve for participants with obesity and 1.04 (1.02e1.07) for those without obesity) after adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking and alcohol status and overall health. The moderate positive association between red and processed meat consumption and ischemic heart disease was only observed in participants without obesity (HR (95%CI): 1.15 (1.00e1.31) for the highest versus lowest terciles of red and processed meat consumption). No association was found with cerebrovascular disease in the participants regardless of obesity. Conclusions: Consumption frequency of red and processed meat is associated with higher risk of CV death regardless of obesity. The risk of ischemic heart disease associated with red and processed meat consumption may be higher in participants without obesity. Further studies are needed to understand the full extent of the mechanism of the association.","Acknowledgements

 Table 8 showed the results obtained from Model 3 by including the intake of poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables as additional variables. The results showed that after adding the additional variables in Model 3, the associations obtained were similar to the results generated from Model 3 excluding these additional variables (shown in the above table). Supplementary Table 9 demonstrated that diabetes variable was added to Model 3 for the multivariable analysis (n ¼ 327,142 participants available) to evaluate the association between red and processed meat consumption frequency and the outcomes. The associations were not altered compared with the results in Model 3 before diabetes variable was considered.

Intrinsic labeling of protein is the only method to directly trace availability and utilization. The purpose of the present study was to produce labeled milk and meat proteins and investigate how dietary protein-derived AA availability is affected by the protein-meal matrix. Methods: Four lactating cows were infused with L-[ring-d 5 ]phenylalanine and one with L-[ 15 N]phenylalanine for 72 h. Milk was collected, and three of the [d 5 ]phenylalanine cows were subsequently slaughtered. Two human studies were performed to explore plasma AA availability properties utilizing the labeled proteins. One study compared the intake of whey protein either alone or together with carbohydrates-fat food-matrix. The other study compared the intake of meat hydrolysate with minced beef. Cow blood, milk, meat and human blood samples were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Results: Whey and caseinate acquired label to 15e20 mol percent excess (MPE), and the meat proteins reached 0.41e0.73 MP E. The [d 5 ]phenylalanine appeared fast in plasma and peaked 30 min after whey protein alone and meat hydrolysate intake, whereas whey protein with a food-matrix and the meat minced beef postponed the [d 5 ]phenylalanine peak until 2 and 1 h, respectively. Conclusions: Phenylalanine stable isotope-labeled milk and meat were produced and proved a valuable tool to investigate AA absorption characteristics. Dietary protein in food-matrices showed delayed postprandial plasma AA availability as compared to whey protein alone and meat hydrolysate.","Q1

However, the associations of meat consumption and changes with mortality among hypertensive patients remain unknown. We aimed to assess the associations of red and white meat consumption with all-cause mortality among hypertensive patients in China. Methods: We followed 8095 hypertensive patients from the China Health and Nutrition Survey between 1991 and 2015. In each survey year, 3-day 24-h dietary records were used to collect dietary data. Cumulative averages of dietary meat intake after the diagnosis of hypertension were calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality. Results: Overall 927 deaths were documented among these hypertensive patients during an average of 11.4 years of follow-up. Red meat consumption was positively associated with all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment [HR (95% CI) comparing the highest versus lowest quartile: 1.29 (1.05e1.57), P trend ¼ 0.02]. White meat intake was associated with lower all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI) comparing the highest tertile with non-consumers: 0.77 (0.63e0.94), P trend ¼ 0.002]. Increasing red meat consumption from before to after hypertension diagnosis was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI): 1.55 (1.05e2.28), P trend ¼ 0.04]. Theoretically replacing 1 ounce/day of red meat with the equivalent amount of white meat or eggs was associated with 5% and 10% lower all-cause mortality, respectively. Conclusions: High consumption of red meat, especially after hypertension diagnosis, is associated with higher mortality among hypertensive patients. Our findings suggest replacing red meat consumption with healthy alternative foods for long-term survival among hypertensive patients.","Acknowledgments

The present review aimed to summarise dietary guidelines relating to meat, actual meat intakes and the contribution of meat to energy and nutrient intakes of children, teenagers and adults in Europe. The available literature has shown that food-based dietary guidelines for most countries recommend consuming lean meat in moderation and many recommend limiting red and processed meat consumption. Mean intakes of total meat in Europe range from 40 to 160 g/d in children and teenagers and from 75 to 233 g/d in adults. Meat contributes to important nutrients such as protein, PUFA, B vitamins, vitamin D and essential minerals such as Fe and Zn; however, processed meat contributes to significant proportions of saturated fat and Na across population groups. While few data are available on diaggregated intakes of red and processed meat, where data are available, mean intakes in adults are higher than the upper limits recommended by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (70 g/d) and the World Cancer Research Fund (500 g/week). While there are no recommendations for red and processed meat consumption in children and teenagers, intakes currently range from 30 to 76 g/d. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of meat in the European diet which may be of use to stakeholders including researchers, policy makers and the agri-food sector.","Acknowledgements

The global increase in meat consumption is associated with the adverse environmental impacts such as increased greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming and higher water/land use. In this review, we focus on the development, availability, and nutritional value of various meat alternatives and their impact on meat consumption. Recent Findings Changing dietary patterns and drive for environmental conservation contribute to the recent increase in the consumption of environmental friendly sources of proteins such as plant-based and mycoprotein-based meat alternatives. Summary Perceived lack of naturalness and poor cultural acceptance present as roadblocks for widespread societal acceptance for meat alternatives. Continued research and efforts are needed to make the meat alternatives more aesthetically appealing with improved nutritive value.",

This study aims to investigate the association of red and processed meat intake with mortality. The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) is a prospective cohort study of~96,000 Seventh-day Adventist men and women recruited in the US and Canada between 2002 and 2007. The final analytic sample after exclusions was 72,149. Cox proportional hazards regression was used and hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) were obtained. Diet was assessed by a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), calibrated using six 24-h dietary recalls. Mortality outcome data were obtained from the National Death Index. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 years, there were 7961 total deaths, of which 2598 were Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) deaths and 1873 were cancer deaths. Unprocessed red meat was associated with risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.31) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05-1.50). Processed meat alone was not significantly associated with risk of mortality. The combined intake of red and processed meat was associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11-1.36) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12-1.60). These findings suggest moderately higher risks of all-cause and CVD mortality associated with red and processed meat in a low meat intake population.","Acknowledgments:

We assessed intakes of major proteinsource foods and other food groups in six groups of meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study. The data were from 30,239 participants who answered questions regarding their consumption of meat, fish, dairy or eggs and completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 2010. Participants were categorized as regular meat-eaters, low meat-eaters, poultry-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans. FFQ foods were categorized into 45 food groups and analysis of variance was used to test for differences between age-adjusted mean intakes of each food group by diet group. Regular meateaters, vegetarians and vegans, respectively, consumed about a third, quarter and a fifth of their total energy intake from high protein-source foods. Compared with regular meat-eaters, low and non-meat-eaters consumed higher amounts of high-protein meat alternatives (soy, legumes, pulses, nuts, seeds) and other plant-based foods (whole grains, vegetables, fruits) and lower amounts of refined grains, fried foods, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages.

The impact of the risk communication of processed meat consumption was simulated using Monte Carlo microsimulation models. The results showed that a 1% reduction in the number of high-level processed meat consumers may lead to a yearly decrease in CRC cases of 406.43 (IC 95%: −243.94, 1056.81), while the more extreme scenario of a 15% reduction may lead to 2086.62 fewer cases (IC 95%: 1426.66, 2746.57). On the other hand, if demand contraction in the processed meat sector resulted in a 0.1% loss in employment, one could expect 27.23 all-cause mortalities attributable to job loss (IC 95%: 16.55, 37.80). This simulation study demonstrates that caution should be taken when implementing public awareness campaigns, particularly when the prevention message is not straightforward.","annex

Using national survey data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Nutrition 2015, we aimed to model a dietary scenario to assess the potential effects of increasing the intake of currently consumed plant-based meat alternatives by 100% and decreasing the consumption of red and processed meat by 50% on the diet quality and nutrient intakes of Canadians (≥1 year). This dietary scenario had no significant impact on dietary energy intake (p > 0.05), but resulted in a significant increase in the dietary intakes of fibre, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, and dietary folate equivalents (p < 0.05). On the other hand, this dietary scenario was accompanied by a significant decrease in protein (from 77.8 ± 0.6 g to 73.4 ± 0.6 g), cholesterol, zinc, and vitamin B12 intake (p < 0.05). Further, based on Nutrient Rich Food (NRF) scores, the overall nutritional value of the simulated diet was higher than the baseline diet. Our modeling showed that the partial replacement of red and processed meat with plant-based alternatives improves overall diet quality but may adversely affect the intake of some micronutrients, especially zinc and vitamin B12.","annex

One of the variables that mainly impacts eating behaviors and thus should be carefully analyzed is sex/gender, and while sex (female/male, in a binary approximation) refers only to biological characteristics, gender (woman/man, in a binary approximation) refers to cultural attitudes and behavior. This study aimed at exploring the role of gender, age, taste responsiveness (measured as sensitivity to the bitterness of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP)), personality traits, attitudes, and liking of and familiarity with meat on the choice of fat-rich meat products in 1208 women and men aged 18-66. Both a between-and a within-gender approach were adopted. Results showed that gender had a major impact on liking of and familiarity with meat and choice for fat-rich meat compared to age. A lower liking meat in general was found in women, independently of fat content. Women also reported a lower familiarity than men with fatty meat and cold meat and a lower choice of fat-rich meat. Genders differed in the influence of personality and attitudes about fat-rich meat choice. In both genders, the choice of meat higher in fat was associated with liking cold and fatty meat and with age and negatively with liking low-fat meat. Women were in general more interested in health than men, and this may explain the main difference in the choice of fat-rich meat between genders. However, when we look at each gender separately, general health interest was significantly correlated with a lower choice of fat-rich meat only in men. In addition, in men food neophobia was negatively correlated with choice of fat-rich meat. In women, the emotional dimension was found to play an important role, with sensitivity to disgust that was negatively associated with fat-rich meat choice and emotional eating that was positively associated with it. Thanks to the large sample and the gender-sensitive approach adopted, this study showed that different factors affect choice of fat-rich meat by gender, in addition to liking of and familiarity with fat-rich and cold meat and age.

Mean (± standard deviation (SD)) and median (range) was calculated for nutrients and HSR. Plant-based options were generally lower in kilojoules, total and saturated fat, higher in carbohydrate, sugars, and dietary fibre compared with meat. Only 4% of products were low in sodium (58-1200 mg/100 g). Less than a quarter of products (24%) were fortified with vitamin B12, 20% with iron, and 18% with zinc.

A particular interest was to enlist views on the harms, benefits, and possible barriers to following plant-based diets. A mixed-methods study involving health professionals completing a questionnaire and a subsequent focus group to collect data was used. Survey data were analysed using spreadsheet software, and thematic content analysis of focus group data was undertaken. Participants provided nutrition advice 2.4 times per day. Almost half of practitioners considered their nutrition knowledge to be inadequate, and most made poor use of references for provision of information. Plant-based diets were generally viewed as beneficial to health, improve quality of life, be filling, but were perceived as not as easy to follow.

Studies which have explored the associations between cognitive function and meat intakes have produced inconsistent findings. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the evidence linking meat intake with cognitive disorders. Twenty-nine studies were retrieved, including twelve cohort, three case-control, thirteen cross-sectional studies, and one intervention study. The majority (21/29) showed that meat consumption was not significantly associated with cognitive function or disorders. Meta-analysis of five studies showed no significant differences in meat consumption between cases with cognitive disorders and controls (standardized mean difference = −0.32, 95% CI: −1.01, 0.36); however, there was considerable heterogeneity. In contrast, a meta-analysis of five studies showed reduced odds of cognitive disorders by consuming meat weekly or more (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.88); however, potential publication bias was noted in relation to this finding. Overall, there was no strong association between meat intake and cognitive disorders. However, the evidence base was limited, requiring more studies of high quality to isolate the specific effect of meat consumption from dietary patterns to confirm these associations.","Acknowledgments:

The first aim of this study is to identify the profiles of consumers based on their involvement in light lamb meat. The second aim is to study the influence of involvement on consumers' attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, preferences, quality cues, and sensory perception regarding light lamb meat. Two consumer profiles are identified. The first cluster includes consumers who enjoyed eating light lamb meat, were conscious of their self-image, and perceived the consequences of poor choices; these consumers also perceived the probability of making an incorrect choice as high. The second cluster includes consumers who truly loved eating lamb meat, were also conscious of their self-image, and perceived the consequences of poor choices; however, these consumers were confident in not making incorrect choices. Although both involvement-based profiles showed high involvement in light lamb meat, it can be concluded that the second cluster had a higher involvement. In general, the involvement-based profiles did not influence health-related attitudes, preferences, or sensory perceptions of light lamb meat, while beliefs, behavior and quality cues were influenced by involvement.","acknowledgement

The aim of this study was to examine the association of alcohol and red meat consumption with life expectancy (LE) by analyzing data from 164 countries using an ecological approach. Design: This was a longitudinal ecological study using data from the United Nation's (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 164 countries over the period 1992-2013. In regression analysis, the relationship of alcohol and red meat consumption with LE was estimated using a pooled ordinary least squares regression model. Alcohol and red meat consumption were measured every 5 years. Results: The consumption of alcohol and red meat in high-income countries (HIC) was about 4 times (36.8-143.0 kcal/capita/day) and 5 times (11.2-51.9 kcal/capita/day) higher than that in low-income countries (LIC). Red meat and alcohol consumption had a negative estimated effect on LE in HIC (b = −1.616 p = < 0.001 and b = −0.615, p = 0.003). Alcohol consumption was negatively associated with LE for all income groups, while positive relationships were found for all estimates associated with gross national income (GNI). Conclusions: Red meat and alcohol consumption appeared to have a negative impact on LE in high-income countries (HIC) and upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), although it had no significant association with LE in low-income countries (LIC) or lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). This study suggests reviewing the policies on the gradual reduction of alcohol abuse and the high consumption of red meat, particularly HIC and UMIC.","annex

The mucus is the outer part of the CMB and is considered as the front-line defense of the colon. It separates the host epithelial lining from the colonic content, and it has previously been linked to health and diseases. In this study, we assessed the relationship between red meat and whole-grain intake and (1) the thickness of the colonic mucus (2) the expression of the predominant mucin gene in the human colon (MUC2). Patients referred to colonoscopy at the University Hospital of Southern Denmark-Sonderjylland were enrolled between June 2017 and December 2018, and lifestyle data was collected in a cross-sectional study design. Colonic biopsies, blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected. The colonic mucus and bacteria were visualized by immunostaining and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques. We found a thinner mucus was associated with high red meat intake. Similarly, the results suggested a thinner mucus was associated with high whole-grain intake, albeit to a lesser extent than red meat. This is the first study assessing the association between red meat and whole-grain intake and the colonic mucus in humans. This study is approved by the Danish Ethics Committee (S-20160124) and the Danish Data Protecting Agency (2008-58-035).

Using national representative data from a recent menuCH Survey, we first aimed to quantify intake of PM and its subtypes, and second to investigate associations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors by multivariable regression analysis. PM was consumed by 72% of the population, and mean daily intake was 42.7 g/day (standard error of the mean (SEM) 1.2 g/day), ranging considerably across PM subtypes: highest intake of sausages 18.1 g/day (SEM 0.7 g/day) and lowest of bacon 2.0 g/day (SEM 0.2 g/day). PM intake by women was 4.7 g/1000 kcal lower than men (95% confidence interval (CI): −6.7; −2.7) and 2.9 g/1000 kcal lower in the French-language region compared with the German region (95% CI: 2.4; 8.7). Among sociodemographic and lifestyle factors examined, BMI (obese vs. normal: 5.5 g/1000 kcal, 95% CI: 2.4; 8.7) and current smoking (vs. never smoked: 3.1 g/kcal, 95% CI: 0.6; 5.6) were independently associated with PM intake. The results are a first description of PM intake, separate from other meat types, and which identified associations with two unhealthy lifestyle factors in Switzerland. Such data will contribute to better nutritional recommendations and guidance for public health interventions.","Acknowledgments:

The influences of GST gene polymorphism and red meat intake on CRC occurrence in the Polish population were analyzed in this study. Methods: Genotyping was performed with the qPCR method. Results: A high frequency of meat consumption was associated with an over 2-fold increase in the risk of colorectal cancer odds ratio (OR) adjusted for sex and age = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.3-4.4). However, after analyzing the genetic profiles, in the absence of polymorphisms of all three analyzed genes, there was no association between a high frequency of meat consumption and the occurrence of CRC. In the case of GSTM1 gene polymorphism, the high frequency of meat consumption increased the risk of CRC by almost more than 4 times (OR adjusted for sex and age = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.6-9.1). For GSTP1 gene polymorphism, a 3-fold increase in CRC risk was observed with a high frequency of meat consumption (OR adjusted for sex and age = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.4-8.1). In the case of GSTT1 gene polymorphism, the increase in risk of CRC was not statistically significant (OR adjusted for sex and age = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.4-8.5). Conclusions: The frequency of red meat intake in non-smokers increases the risk of colon cancer in the case of GST gene polymorphisms.","Acknowledgments:

However, red meat intake was recently suspected to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We evaluated the association of red meat intake with CVD mortality risk in Japanese with/without reduced kidney function. Overall, 9112 participants of a Japanese national survey in 1980, aged ≥30 years, were followed for 29 years. Red meat intake was assessed using weighed dietary record. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of CVD mortality according to sex-specific tertiles of red meat intake. We also performed stratified analyses with/without reduced kidney function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Red meat intake was not associated with CVD mortality risk in men and women. In stratified analyses, the HR of the highest compared with the lowest tertile of red meat intake was lower only in women with reduced kidney function (0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.98). In conclusion, there were no clear associations between red meat intake and CVD mortality risk in Japanese population; however, a higher intake of red meat was associated with lower risk of future CVD mortality in women with reduced kidney function.","Acknowledgments:

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the exact associations that red, processed, and white meat have with gastric cancer. We searched relevant studies in Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library before November 2018, including cohort and case-control studies. We used random-effect models to estimate the adjusted relative risk (RR), and Egger's tests to evaluate publication bias. Through stepwise screening, 43 studies were included in this analysis (11 cohort studies and 32 case-control studies with 16,572 cases). In a meta-analysis for the highest versus lowest categories of meat consumption, both red (RR: 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.66) and processed (RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.37-1.81) meat consumption were positively associated with gastric cancer risk, while white meat consumption was negatively associated with gastric cancer risk (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.92). In a dose-response meta-analysis, the RRs of gastric cancer were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.11-1.42) for every 100 g/day increment in red meat consumption, 1.72 (95% CI: 1.36-2.18) for every 50 g/day increment in processed meat consumption, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.64-1.15) for every 100 g/day increment in white meat consumption. The increase of white meat consumption may reduce the risk of gastric cancer, while red or processed meat may increase the risk of gastric cancer. Further studies are required to identify these associations, especially between white meat and gastric cancer.",

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of a red meat diet on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in pigs. Weaned pigs (42 days old) were fed either a control diet or a diet substituted with 15% minced, cooked and dried beef from experimental day 0 to 14. From day 14 to 18, half of the pigs on each diet received a daily oral dose of DSS. Dietary red meat aggravated the severity of colitis based on clinical signs of disease (negative performance score) and histopathological parameters in the colon such as erosion/ulceration and the overall inflammation score but no negative effects were observed on systemic health or small intestinal permeability. Importantly, dietary meat also caused a potential beneficial reduction in the colonic expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-6, the pro-inflammatory enzyme PTGS2 and in the chemokine IL-8. The present study emphasizes the potential of diet to modulate mucosal inflammation and that a red meat diet might be a risk factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease.","Conflicts of Interest:

Sodium nitrite has emerged as a putative candidate responsible for the CRC-inducing effects of processed meats. Sodium nitrite is purported to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum and other food-spoiling bacteria, but recent, contradictory peer-reviewed evidence has emerged, leading to media reports questioning the necessity of nitrite addition. To date, eleven preclinical studies have investigated the effect of consuming nitrite/nitrite-containing meat on the development of CRC, but the results do not provide an overall consensus. A sizable number of human clinical studies have investigated the relationship between processed meat consumption and CRC risk with widely varying results. The unique approach of the present literature review was to include analysis that limited the human studies to those involving only nitrite-containing meat. The majority of these studies reported that nitrite-containing processed meat was associated with increased CRC risk. Nitrite consumption can lead to the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), some of which are carcinogenic. Therefore, this focused perspective based on the current body of evidence links the consumption of meat containing nitrites and CRC risk.",

The development of effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes mellitus based on the selection of methods to restore and maintain blood glucose homeostasis is still in progress. Among the different courses of action, inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) can improve blood glucose control in diabetic patients. Pharmacological therapy offering synthetic drugs is commonly used. In addition to medication, dietary intervention may be effective in combating metabolic disturbances caused by diabetes mellitus. Food proteins as a source of biologically active sequences are a potential source of anti-diabetic peptides (DPP-IV inhibitors and glucose uptake stimulating peptides). This study showed that in silico pork meat proteins digested with gastrointestinal enzymes are a potential source of bioactive peptides with a high potential to control blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Analysis revealed that the sequences released during in silico digestion were small dipeptides (with an average weight of 270.07 g mol −1), and most were poorly soluble in water. The selected electron properties of the peptides with the highest bioactivity index (i.e., GF, MW, MF, PF, PW) were described using the DFT method. The contribution of hydrophobic amino acids, in particular Phe and Trp, in forming the anti-diabetic properties of peptides released from pork meat was emphasized.","annex

In the Yogurt group, the contribution of regulatory T cells to MLN and PP was higher compared to the other groups. We confirmed that diet supplementation with yogurt modulates the immune response to the prime allergen, and changes the activity of serum antibodies to milk proteins and BSA.

Development of functional meat products that contain bioactive components are presented as a great nutritional strategy. Until now, the effect of the consumption of restructured meat enriched with CFE in a murine model of diabetes has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect on glycemia, lipemia, lipoprotein profile, Ldlr, arylesterase (AE), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and liver oxidation in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NAD) growing Wistar diabetic rats fed restructured meat in the frame of a high cholesterol/high saturated-fat diet. In the present study, three groups (D, ED and DE) were fed cholesterol-enriched (1.4% cholesterol and 0.2% cholic acid) and high saturated-fat diets (50% of total energy from fats and 20.4% from saturated fatty acids). Rats were subjected to a STZ-NAD administration at the 3rd week. Group D did not receive CFE, while ED and DE rat groups received CFE before and after the diabetic induction, respectively. After eight weeks, D rats showed hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia, an increased amount cholesterol-enriched VLDL (β-VLDL), IDL and LDL particles and triglyceride-enriched HDL. ED and DE partially blocked the hypercholesterolemic induction with respect to D group (p < 0.001) and improved glycemia, cholesterol levels, lipoprotein profile, Ldlr, plasma AE activity and liver oxidation (p < 0.001). Fecal fat, moisture and excretion were higher while dietary digestibility was lower in ED and DE vs. D counterparts (p < 0.001). In conclusion, CFE-enriched meat shows, for the first time, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in STZ-NAD animals fed high cholesterol/high saturated-fat diets. Likewise, it manages to reverse possible diabetes lipoprotein alterations if CFE-enriched meat is consumed before pathology development or improves said modifications if Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is already established.","Acknowledgments:

The data were from nine waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2015), a longitudinal, open cohort study. The surveys were conducted in 303 urban and rural communities of 15 provinces in China. Collected by consecutive three-day 24-h dietary recalls combined with household weighing for foods or only condiments, the diet exposure of interest was daily red meat intake and its subtypes (fatty versus lean) defined by 10-g fat content per 100 g. The main outcome was systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and risk of elevated BP defined as having a mean of SBP ≥ 135 mmHg, DBP ≥ 85 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive medication. Three-level mixed-effect regressions showed women had SBP increases of 2.19 mmHg (95% CI: 1.07, 4.46) from a higher intake of total fresh red meat, 2.42 mmHg (95% CI: 1.18, 4.94) from a higher intake of fatty, fresh red meat, as well as 0.48 mmHg (95% CI: 0.26, 0.88) from a higher intake of lean, fresh red meat in the top tertile versus bottom one when adjusted for potential confounders. After adjusting for survey years, women with the highest tertile of lean, fresh red meat intake had a 32% lower risk of elevated BP (OR 0.68, 95%CI:0.48, 0.96) as compared with those with the first tertile (non-consumer). Fatty and lean, fresh red meat intakes were differentially associated with BP among Chinese adults. Further research is required to elicit the potential mechanism on gender-specific differential association of fatty versus lean, fresh red meat with BP.","acknowledgement

We tested the acute effect of meal composition on these hormones in three population groups. A randomized crossover design was used to examine the effects of two energy-and macronutrient-matched meals: a processed-meat and cheese (M-meal) and a vegan meal with tofu (V-meal) on gastrointestinal hormones, and satiety in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 20), obese men (O, n = 20), and healthy men (H, n = 20). Plasma concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), amylin, and peptide YY (PYY) were determined at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Visual analogue scale was used to assess satiety. We used repeated-measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for statistical analysis. Postprandial secretion of GLP-1 increased after the V-meal in T2D (by 30.5%; 95%CI 21.2 to 40.7%; p < 0.001) and H (by 15.8%; 95%CI 8.6 to 23.5%; p = 0.01). Postprandial plasma concentrations of amylin increased in in all groups after the V-meal: by 15.7% in T2D (95%CI 11.8 to 19.6%; p < 0.001); by 11.5% in O (95%CI 7.8 to 15.3%; p = 0.03); and by 13.8% in H (95%CI 8.4 to 19.5%; p < 0.001). An increase in postprandial values of PYY after the V-meal was significant only in H (by 18.9%; 95%CI 7.5 to 31.3%; p = 0.03). Satiety was greater in all participants after the V-meal: by 9% in T2D (95%CI 4.4 to 13.6%; p = 0.004); by 18.7% in O (95%CI 12.8 to 24.6%; p < 0.001); and by 25% in H (95%CI 18.2 to 31.7%; p < 0.001). Our results indicate there is an increase in gut hormones and satiety, following consumption of a single plant-based meal with tofu when compared with an energy-and macronutrient-matched processed-meat meat and cheese meal, in healthy, obese and diabetic men.","annex

We sought to determine the feasibility of a high GLV dietary intervention in adults with an increased risk of CC (NCT03582306) via a 12-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained. Fifty adults were recruited in 44 days. Participants were 48 ± 13 years of age, 62% female, and 80% Caucasian, with an average BMI at screening of 35.9 ± 5.1. Fortyeight (96%) participants were retained and completed the study. During the intervention phase, participants consumed GLVs on 88.8% of days; the adherence goal of one cup was met on 73.2% of days. Dietary recall-derived Vitamin K and GLVs significantly increased for all participants during the intervention periods. Overall satisfaction did not differ between intervention and control periods (p = 0.214). This feasibility trial achieved accrual, retention and acceptability goals, but fell slightly short of the benchmark for adherence. The analysis of biological specimens will determine the effects of GLVs on gut microbiota, oxidative DNA damage, and inflammatory cytokines.","annex

However, the content of cholesterol and saturated fat is higher than in some other food groups. Processed meat is defined as products usually made of red meat that are cured, salted or smoked (e.g. ham or bacon) in order to improve the durability of the food and/or to improve colour and taste, and often contain a high amount of minced fatty tissue (e.g. sausages). Hence, high consumption of processed foods may lead to an increased intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, salt, nitrite, haem iron, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and, depending upon the chosen food preparation method, also heterocyclic amines. Several large cohort studies have shown that a high consumption of processed (red) meat is related to increased overall and cause-specific mortality. A meta-analysis of nine cohort studies observed a higher mortality among high consumers of processed red meat (relative risk (RR) = 1•23; 95 % CI 1•17, 1•28, top v. bottom consumption category), but not unprocessed red meat (RR = 1•10; 95 % CI 0•98, 1•22). Similar associations were reported in a second meta-analysis. All studies argue that plausible mechanisms are available linking processed meat consumption and risk of chronic diseases such as CVD, diabetes mellitus or some types of cancer. However, the results of meta-analyses do show some degree of heterogeneity between studies, and it has to be taken into account that individuals with low red or processed meat consumption tend to have a healthier lifestyle in general. Hence, substantial residual confounding cannot be excluded. Information from other types of studies in man is needed to support a causal role of processed meat in the aetiology of chronic diseases, e.g. studies using the Mendelian randomisation approach.","Authorship

Nevertheless, foods are not consumed in isolation and therefore it is important to consider the overall diet when investigating associations between diet and biomarkers of CVD and T2D. The aim of this analysis was to identify dietary patterns, with an emphasis on processed red meat contributions, in a sub cohort (n = 786) of the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS). The NANS was a crosssectional food consumption survey carried out between 2008 and 2010 in an Irish adult population (n = 1500), a four day semiweighted food diary was used to collect habitual food and beverage intakes, and 79 % of participants provided blood samples (2). All meat-containing food codes were assigned to one of four meat food groups (n = 502), on the basis of red or white meat, and by processed or unprocessed. Processed meat included products which had undergone salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, flavour enhancement or other preservation processes. The remaining food codes (n = 2050) were assigned to 29 food groups, based on those previously identified in an Irish population (3). All food groups were expressed as a percentage contribution to total energy intake (%TE) and z-scores were calculated. Two-step and K-means cluster analysis was applied to derive dietary clusters. Dietary quality was assessed using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED) indices (4) .",

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between dietary habits and weight gain over 14 years in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford cohort. The analysis included data from 10,687 women and 2,516 men <60 years of age at follow-up (20-48 years at baseline). Dietary habits were categorised as meat-eating (3781 women, 903 men), pescatarian (ate fish but not meat; 1109 women, 209 men), vegetarians (2729 women, 711 men) and vegans (200 women, 125 men), if these diets were followed both at baseline and follow-up. Participants who were not assigned the same category at baseline and follow-up were categorised as 'reverters' for any step in the direction from vegan to meat-eating (2394 women, 451 men) and 'converters' for any step in the direction from meat-eating to vegan (474 women, 118 men). Weight was self-reported at baseline and follow-up and validated in a sub-sample (2). Mean annual weight gain was multiplied by the mean follow-up time of 14 years. Linear regression was used to compare mean weight gain across diets, adjusting for age, ethnicity, current job, age leaving school, marital status, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake and body mass index, and stratified by sex. Mean 14 year weight gain was 4.9 (SD 8.0) kg in women and 4.9 (SD 7.4) kg in men. Sustained pescatarians (women p <0.001, men p <0.05), vegans (women p <0.001, men p <0.05) and those converting towards lower animal product intake (women p <0.001, men p <0.01) gained significantly less weight than women and men who ate meat (Figure 1). Additionally, vegetarian men gained less weight than meat-eating men (p = 0.040). The study findings suggest that a reduction in animal products, sustained pescatarian and vegan diets are associated with lower long-term weight gain in adulthood compared with diets that include meat.",

Meat consumption might play a role in inflammatory processes, but prospective research on the associations of meat intake and markers of systemic inflammation is limited and suggests that the association might be entirely explained by higher adiposity (2). The aim of this study was to assess the prospective association of meat consumption (total, unprocessed red, and processed meat, and poultry) with C-reactive protein (CRP) and total white blood cell count (WBCC) in British adults. A secondary aim was to investigate the role of central adiposity in the association. The study was based on participants from the UK Biobank cohort study that was established between 2006 and 2010. Meat intake was determined at baseline using questionnaires ascertaining weekly consumption, categorised into groups of intake based on distribution and daily intakes based on estimated portion sizes. CRP concentrations and WBCC were measured in non-fasting blood samples collected from 15,433 participants in 2012-2013 (median 4.4 years after recruitment). We used multivariable linear regression models to determine the associations of meat consumption categorically, and per 50g/day higher intake with CRP and WBCC. We then reran the analyses adjusted for waist circumference to examine the role of central adiposity. CRP concentrations were positively associated with total meat intake, ranging from adjusted geometric means of 1.04 mg/L (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.00-1.09) in those who ate meat <3 times/week to 1.40 mg/L (95%-CI 1.36-1.44) in those who ate it 7+ times/ week (standardised β per 50g/day higher intake 0.11, 95%-CI 0.09-0.13 for log CRP). Across the same categories, geometric means for WBCC were 6.39 x109/L (95%-CI 6.30-6.47) and 6.68 x109/L (95%-CI 6.62-6.74; standardised β per 50g/day higher intake 0.05, 95%-CI 0.03, 0.07 for log WBCC). We also observed positive associations with CRP and WBCC when investigating unprocessed red, processed meat and poultry intake, separately. When adjusting for central adiposity all associations were attenuated (e.g. for 50g/day higher intake of total meat, the standardised β 0.08, 95%-CI 0.06, 0.10 for log CRP, and 0.03, 95%-CI 0.01, 0.05 for log WBCC). This is the largest prospective study to investigate associations of meat intake with inflammatory markers. The findings suggest that total meat intake, including unprocessed red meat, processed meat and poultry, is associated with higher CRP and WBCC, partly explained by increased central adiposity in those with higher meat intakes.","Acknowledgements

Numerous studies have shown that a healthy diet with a high intake of fish and seafood, poultry, vegetables, fruits, legumes, through the high content of antioxidants are associated with better parameters of semen quality and reduced risk of asthenozoospermia. Men's diets may affect spermatogenesis as reflected in semen quality indicators, but the literature on the relation between meat intake and semen quality is limited. Our objective was to prospectively examine the relation between meats including red, poultry, proceesed and fish and indicators of semen quality. Men in subfertile couples presenting for evaluation at the Olsztyn Hospital Fertility Center were invited to participate in an ongoing study of environmental factors and fertility. This cross-sectional study was carried out in 208 men aged 18-55 years from Northern-Eastern Poland. Semen samples were collected at the clinic and analyses were performed by an experienced technician. Semen microscopic measurements were determined with the use of computer-aided semen analysis (CASA) and evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. A total of men completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire and subsequently provided semen samples. We used linear mixed regression models to examine the relation between meat intake and semen quality indicators (total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology, and semen volume) while adjusting for potential confounders. After adjustment for age, BMI, physical activity, residence place and education, one serving increase in intake of processed meat was associated with a 56% higher risk of abnormal progressive sperm motility (OR = 1.56 95%CI:1.09-2.21). Consuming processed meat may have a negative impact on sperm counts and morphology. Potentially, these products may be a significant source of saturated and trans fatty acids, xenobiotics, mainly xenoestrogen, and steroids. Is need to clarify the potential effect of meat products, especially processed meat, on male reproductive potential in RCTs or longitudinal studies. Future findings may be useful to establish a more precise recommendation connected with red and processed meat intake in the context of reproductive health.","Conflict of Interest

It uses secondary data to examine the patterns of meat consumption across the globe, and drawing on academic and grey literature, it outlines some of the policy, market and social trends and issues influencing demand and supply of meat. It also presents an overview of the scientific evidence base regarding the pros and cons of meat consumption. The results show that consumption patterns are not homogeneous globally, nor across meat types, with overall meat consumption increasing strongly in developing countries but stagnating in developed countries, and demand for poultry increasing in most regions in contrast to beef. They also illustrate the evolving impact of factors such as income on consumption and the increasing impact of non-economic factors, such as social and policy influences relating to health and the environment, on food choice behaviours, to the extent that such behaviours are increasingly entering a moral space. Given the solid scientific evidence that simultaneously substantiates arguments to increase and decrease meat consumption, it is clear that dietary recommendations need to be context-specific. An important part of the context is the strategies being pursued by researchers and supply chain actors, from farmers through to processors, retailers and food service operators, to improve the sustainability credentials of livestock production. As new evidence emerges from such initiatives, the context will change which means that dietary guidelines will require continuous review.","Conflict of Interest

Pulses present benefits that may improve the sustainability of our systems and diets, such as their ability to restore soils in nitrogen and their high contents in proteins, fibers and minerals. However, pulses also contain several bioactive compounds such as phytates or tannins that can negatively affect mineral absorption. Additionally, we recently showed in the laboratory that these bioactives, together with fibers and saponins, could negatively impact fat-soluble vitamin bioavailability. The objective of this study was thus to follow up vitamin D (as a model of fat-soluble vitamin) and iron (as a model of mineral) transfer to the aqueous phase of the bolus during digestion of meal containing or not pulses. To this aim, we performed in vitrodigestion using tests meals made of beef (as a model of meat) and/or semolina (as a model of cereals) and/or chickpeas (as a model of pulses). To identify the compounds responsible for the observed effects, we also performed in vitrodigestion using test meals made of potatoes supplemented or not in fibers, phytates, tannins and saponines. Vitamin D bioaccessibility and iron solubility were expressed as the ratio of vitamin D or iron recovered in the aqueous phase of the digestion on the total amount of vitamin D or iron recovered in the whole digesta, at the end of the digestion. Our results showed that the presence of chickpeas within a meal induced a significant decrease of both vitamin D bioaccessibility (up to-56%, p < 0.05) and iron solubility (up to-28%, p < 0.05) compared to meals containing only meat and/or semolina. However, this effect was largely compensated for vitamin D by the fact that this vitamin was less stable (loss > 50%, p < 0.05) during the digestion of meal containing meat compared to meals containing only plant-based foods (i.e. semolina and chickpeas). Among the different bioactives, tannins appear to be the most deleterious regarding iron solubility, while both phytates and tannins were responsible for a decreased in vitamin D bioaccessibility. Our results confirm that in some conditions, the presence of pulses within a meal can be deleterious regarding vitamin D and iron bioavailability. These data thus encourage research to propose dietary and technological solutions to tackle pulse negative effects on micronutrient bioavailability.","Conflict of Interest

This study aims to characterize no-, low-and high-meat consumers and describe their protein intake using data from the Swiss nutrition survey menuCH.This first national survey assessed descriptive factors by a questionnaire and dietary intake by 24-hour dietary recall (24 HDR) across all three linguistic regions, German, French and Italian of Switzerland (N = 2057). Data from the questionnaire (food avoidance) and two 24 HDRs were used to categorize total participants (N) into four subgroups: no meat (4.4%); low (15%), medium (65.6%), or high-meat eaters (15%), based on meat-energy contributions of 0; 0-2.4; 2.4-18.7; 18.7-48.4, respectively. Contributions of overall macronutrients and protein from the different food groups were described for each subgroup to identify quantitative and qualitative differences. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to predict the probability of belonging to one of the four subgroups according to the following sociodemographic and behavioral variables: sex, language region, age, nationality, marital status, education, gross household income, BMI, physical activity, smoking, dietary supplements and overall health status. The subgroups differed in protein intake with 11.5%, 12.8%, 15.4% and 19.1% of total energy intake for no-, low-,medium-and high-meat diets, respectively, weighted for sampling design, non-response, weekdays and season. In general, no-and low-meat consumers included a greater variety of foods contributing to protein intake than meat consumers, including more dairy products and meat-alternatives. None of the subgroups met the Swiss Food-based Dietary Guidelines of three portions of dairy products per day. The regression analysis showed that sex, taking dietary supplements or not and BMI were important determinants of the subgroups: women had a higher predicted probability than men to be no-and low-meat eaters and for these same subgroups, individuals showed higher probabilities for taking dietary supplements. Overweight and obese participants showed higher probabilities to be high-meat eaters. These findings show considerable differences in protein intake and in variety of protein-food selections, between extremes of meat intake (no-to high meat consumption). Future surveys should include frequency methods to allow conclusions about habitual meat intake or avoidance and health status screening to analyse individuals health data.","Conflict of Interest

Data on CRC incidence for men and women and by region is available in Switzerland, but cannot be linked with PM intake. This secondary analysis aimed to describe PM consumption in Switzerland, using data from the National Nutritional Survey menuCH, to investigate associations between PM intake and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and to examine CRC incidence in Switzerland for any similar regional patterns to PM consumption. Intakes of total PM and of categories ham, bacon, sausage and other PM types were described by means and standard errors (SEM). Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate associations between meat intake (total meat and PM, assessed separately, g/1000 kcal) and the following sociodemographic and lifestyle factors: sex, language-speaking region, age-category, nationality, education, gross household income, household status, smoking status, overall health status (self-reported), and currently following a weight-loss diet. Data were weighted for age, sex, marital status, major areas of Switzerland, nationality and household size, and for consumption data, also season and weekday. Results show PM was consumed by approximately 70% of the population with mean total intake of 42.7 (SEM 1.2 g/d). Sausage intake was highest with 16.8 g/day, followed by ham, other PM and bacon, 12.4, 10.6, and 2.0 g/day, respectively. Sex was significantly associated with total meat and PM intake; women consumed 10.1 g/1000 kcal less total meat [95% CI:-13.60;-6.64], and 4.70 g /1000 kcal less PM [95% CI:-6.73;-2.68] than men. For both variables, total meat and PM intake, positive associations were observed for overweight, obesity and current smoking; and negative associations observed for tertiary education and following a diet. The later was significant only for PM intake. The ecological data for CRC incidence revealed much higher rates for men than women, over 24 years; but the data shown by language region did not reveal any particular pattern. This study is the first to describe intakes of total and different PM types, based on national representative data. Positive associations between PM intake and smoking and obesity merit careful monitoring. More regular data collection by methods enabling separate quantification of meat and PM, as well as relevant health biomarkers are needed in future studies.","Conflict of Interest

This cross-sectional study aimed to describe DS use among fish eaters, vegetarians, vegans and meat eaters and to investigate its impact on nutritional inadequacy and its association with sociodemographic characteristics. Potentially at-risk DS use which include DS-drugs contraindicated associations; use of DS pointed out by safety authorities; and excess of tolerable upper intake levels were also described. Material and methods: 76,925 participants to the NutriNet-Santé cohort who completed a quantitative DS questionnaire and three 24 h dietary records were classified into 4 diet groups: 74,558 meat eaters, 1,126 fish eaters, 793 strict vegetarians and 448 vegans. A composition database including > 8000 DS was used. The prevalence of nutritional inadequacy was determined based on usual dietary intakes corrected by variance reduction, and analyses were weighted according to the French census data. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to estimate the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and DS use.","Conflict of Interest

Using the USDA's Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), our objective was to disaggregate the 'cured meat' FPED variable into cured red meat (CRM) and cured poultry (CP) to describe mean intakes in the U.S. population. Methods: Two researchers independently manually disaggregated the 'cured meat' FPED variable into CRM or CP based on food code description, ingredients, and What We Eat in America category. We then developed a SAS program to mimic the manual coding. We estimated consumption prevalence and mean intake of CRM and CP using 1-day dietary recalls for individuals aged 2+ years in NHANES 2011-2016 (n = 23,917). Additionally, we assessed differences by age, sex, self-identified Hispanic origin and race, education, and income (Tukey adjusted P < 0.05). Intakes are reported as mean ± standard error. We used weighted SAS survey commands for all analyses. Results: Overall, CRM comprised 73% of total cured meat, 32% of total red meat, and CP comprised 12% of total poultry. Forty-three % of respondents reported CRM, 13% reported CP, and prevalence decreased with age for both. Mean intakes were 0.3 ± 0.01 oz.-eq/1000 kcal for CRM and 0.1 ± 0.01 oz.-eq/1000 kcal for CP, with no linear age trends. Females reported 0.1 ± 0.02 oz.-eq/1000 kcal less CRM than males but similar CP. Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanics reported less CRM than non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Non-Hispanic Asians reported less CP than Hispanics and both reported less than non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Intakes of CP, but not CRM, were 0.04 ± 0.01 oz.-eq/1000 kcal higher for those with more vs less education. Intakes of CRM or CP did not differ for those above vs below the federal poverty line. Mean intakes were 1.0 ± 0.01 oz.-eq/1000 kcal for total red meat (CRM + 'meat' FPED variable) and 1.1 ± 0.02 oz.-eq/1000 kcal for total poultry (CP + 'poultry' FPED variable). Conclusions: Most cured meat consumed in the U.S. is cured red meat. Both cured red meat and cured poultry are episodically consumed. These newly established FPED-aligned variables can be used to assess chronic disease risk of cured animal protein food consumption with greater specificity. Funding Sources: Not applicable.",

We estimated that between 1995 and 2005, the livestock sector was responsible for greenhouse gas emissions of 5.6-7.5 GtCO 2 e yr-1. Livestock accounts for up to half of the technical mitigation potential of the agriculture, forestry and land-use sectors, through management options that sustainably intensify livestock production, promote carbon sequestration in rangelands and reduce emissions from manures, and through reductions in the demand for livestock products. The economic potential of these management alternatives is less than 10% of what is technically possible because of adoption constraints, costs and numerous trade-offs. The mitigation potential of reductions in livestock product consumption is large, but their economic potential is unknown at present. More research and investment are needed to increase the affordability and adoption of mitigation practices, to moderate consumption of livestock products where appropriate, and to avoid negative impacts on livelihoods, economic activities and the environment.","Acknowledgements

While our knowledge of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) mitigation has evolved, the prevailing focus has been-somewhat myopically-on technology applications associated with mitigation. Here, we (1) examine the global distribution of livestock GHG emissions, (2) explore social, economic and environmental co-benefits and trade-offs associated with mitigation interventions, and (3) critique approaches for quantifying GHG emissions. This review uncovered many insights. First, while GHG emissions from ruminant livestock are greatest in low and middle-income countries (LMIC; globally, 66% of emissions are produced by Latin America and the Caribbean, East and southeast Asia, and south Asia), the majority of mitigation strategies are designed for developed countries. This serious concern is heightened by the fact that 80% of growth in global meat production over the next decade will occur in LMIC. Second, few studies concurrently assess social, economic and environmental aspects of mitigation. Of the 54 interventions reviewed, only 16 had triple-bottom line benefit with medium-high mitigation potential. Third, while efforts designed to stimulate adoption of strategies allowing both emissions reduction (ER) and carbon sequestration (CS) would achieve the greatest net emissions mitigation, CS measures have greater potential mitigation and co-benefits. The scientific community must shift attention away from the prevailing myopic lens on carbon, towards more holistic, systems-based, multi-metric approaches that carefully consider the raison d'être for livestock systems. Consequential life-cycle assessments and systems-aligned 'socioeconomic planetary boundaries' offer useful starting points that may uncover leverage points and cross-scale emergent properties. Derivation of harmonised, globally-reconciled sustainability metrics requires iterative dialogue between stakeholders at all levels. Greater emphasis on the simultaneous characterisation of multiple sustainability dimensions would help avoid situations where progress made in one area causes maladaptive outcomes in other areas.","Acknowledgements

However, livestock manure contains various contaminants including antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here we investigated the variation of antibiotic resistome and its influencing factors during a commercial livestock manure composting. The results showed that composting could effectively reduce the relative abundance of ARGs and mobile genic elements (MGEs). As the dominant phylum in the composting samples, the key potential bacterial host of ARGs were Actinobacteria such as Leucobacter, Mycobacterium and Thermomonosporaceae unclassified. Meanwhile, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Haemophilus ducreyi and Siccibacter turicensis may be the key potential pathogenic host of ARGs because of their co-occurrence with ARG subtypes. Redundancy analysis showed that the dissipation of ARGs during composting was linked to various environmental factors such as moisture. Bacterial succession as well as profile of biocide and metal resistance genes (BMRGs) were the determinants which constructed the antibiotic resistome during manure composting. However, the residues of ARGs and pathogens in compost products may still pose risks to human and crops after fertilization.","Acknowledgement

Across many regions a typical dairy intensification pathway is for dairy farms to specialize on milk production and reduce the co-production of beef (i.e. 'dairy-beef'). Dairy-beef thus reduces and beef needs to be produced elsewhere if beef production is to be maintained. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies quantifying the environmental implications of dairy and beef production have largely focused on the farm level and not captured system connections. Further LCA work has generally represented the 'average' farm of a region, consequently ignoring the range in farm management observed in practice and few studies consider a range of LCA environmental footprints other than carbon footprints. For the first time, we present comprehensive LCA results for multiple environmental burdens based on a large panel dataset for commercial dairy and suckler-beef farms. We present a 15-year LCA assessment of a total of 738 dairy (3624 data points in 15 years) and 1887 suckler-beef (10,340 data points in 15 years) UK farms for five major LCA footprints. We also explore the footprint implications of compensating for reduced dairy-beef through producing this 'displaced' beef on suckler-beef farms. We found a substantial variation in farm footprints not captured in 'average farm' studies. Dairy-beef was much more efficient than beef produced on suckler-beef farms in terms of footprints per unit of beef output. Reducing dairy-beef and replacing it on a suckler-beef farm generally significantly increased environmental burdens. A reduction in carbon footprint was also associated with a reduction in other burdens suggesting no trade-off between local and global emissions. Increasing dairy farm diversification via higher dairy-beef output per unit of milk reduced burdens by up to 11-56%, on average, depending on burden and sensitivity run. We conclude that overspecialization of dairy farms in milk production increases the combined burdens from beef and milk, and that more intensive beef systems that make more efficient use of forage land play a crucial role in mitigating these burdens.","Acknowledgements

The causes of these effects are still poorly understood. This panel study attempts to assess the acute effects of livestock-related air pollution in patients with COPD living in an area with intensive livestock farming in the Netherlands. Between February 2015 and July 2016, 82 participants took spirometry measurements twice daily (morning and evening) during a 3-month period, resulting in 12,672 FEV 1 and PEF records. Participants also kept a diary on respiratory symptoms as well as livestock-related odor annoyance. Daily average ammonia (NH 3) (a proxy for livestock-related air pollution) and fine particulate matter (PM 10) levels were collected from monitoring stations in the area. Lung function was analyzed as decrements of > 10% and > 20% from their median as well as absolute values. Self-reported odor annoyance was analyzed as a dichotomous variable. All analyses were done using generalized estimated equations. We adjusted for humidity, temperature, linear trend, and took multiple testing into account. We found an odds ratio of 1.14 95%CI [1.05; 1.25] for decrements > 20% in morning FEV 1 per interquartile range (12 µg/m 3) increase in NH 3 concentration (lag 2). Odor annoyance was negatively associated with evening PEF (−4.46 l/min 95%CI [−7.59; −1.33]). Sensitivity analyses showed a stronger effect in participants with worse baseline lung function. No associations with symptoms were found. Our results show acute effects of livestock-related air pollution on lung function in COPD patients living in close proximity to livestock farms.","Acknowledgements

Livestock farm emissions involve complex mixtures of various gases and particles. Endotoxin, a pro-inflammatory agent of microbial origin, is a constituent of livestock farm emitted particulate matter (PM) that is potentially related to the observed health effects. Quantification of livestock associated endotoxin exposure at residential addresses in relation to health outcomes has not been performed earlier. Objectives: We aimed to assess exposure-response relations for a range of respiratory endpoints and atopic sensitization in relation to livestock farm associated PM 10 and endotoxin levels. Methods: Self-reported respiratory symptoms of 12,117 persons participating in a population-based cross-sectional study were analyzed. For 2494 persons, data on lung function (spirometry) and serologically assessed atopic sensitization was additionally available. Annual-average PM 10 and endotoxin concentrations at home addresses were predicted by dispersion modelling and land-use regression (LUR) modelling. Exposure-response relations were analyzed with generalized additive models. Results: Health outcomes were generally more strongly associated with exposure to livestock farm emitted endotoxin compared to PM 10. An inverse association was observed for dispersion modelled exposure with atopic sensitization (endotoxin: p = .004, PM 10 : p = .07) and asthma (endotoxin: p = .029, PM 10 : p = .022). Prevalence of respiratory symptoms decreased with increasing endotoxin concentration at the lower range, while at the higher range prevalence increased with increasing concentration (p < .05). Associations between lung function parameters with exposure to PM 10 and endotoxin were not statistically significant (p > .05). Conclusions: Exposure to livestock farm emitted particulate matter is associated with respiratory health effects and atopic sensitization in non-farming residents. Results indicate endotoxin to be a potentially plausible etiologic agent, suggesting non-infectious aspects of microbial emissions from livestock farms to be important with respect to public health.","Acknowledgements

Livestock manure is a potentially important reservoir of mcr-1 because colistin has been widely used in livestock production. Efforts made to accurately quantify the prevalence of mcr-1 in livestock manure and the dynamic changes therein during thermophilic composting have been few and far between. In this study, mcr-1 in 51 collected samples from four kinds of livestock manures was detected and quantified. In total, 16 manure samples were found to be mcr-1 positive, with a detection frequency of 31% in 51 samples. The numbers of mcr-1 gene copies in 12 positive manure samples with a high prevalence of mcr-1 were 10 7-10 9 copies/g dry weight. During composting, > 90% of mcr-1 in the manure was eliminated in 15 days at high temperature (44-65°C), and mcr-1 was completely undetectable after 22 days. The reduction of mcr-1 following manure composting may be ascribed to the decreased number of potential mcr-1-harboring bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas. The results indicated that thermophilic composting effectively eliminated mcr-1 and inhibited its spread from livestock manure to the environment.","Acknowledgments

Thus, there is a global drive to reduce antibiotic use in the agricultural sector. However, it has not been established whether a reduction in the use of antibiotics in livestock production would be effective in reducing the spread of ARGs. A microcosm approach was used to determine how the addition of manure with either reduced antibiotic levels or with typical antibiotic levels could affect the spread of antibiotic resistance genes between soil, earthworms and the phyllosphere. When compared to the control soil, earthworm and phyllosphere samples had the greater increase in ARG abundance in conventional manure treatments (P < 0.05). Reduced antibiotic manure also enriched the abundance of ARGs in the phyllosphere and soil but not earthworm guts when compared to the control (P < 0.05). In both soil and earthworm guts, the enrichment of ARGs was lower in reduced antibiotic manure than in conventional manure. This study has identified bacterial transfer through the soil-earthworm-phyllosphere system as a potential means to spread ARGs between habitats after fertilization with livestock derived manures.","Acknowledgements

Furthermore, outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have struck Korea consistently since 2014. Public concern regarding the deterioration of the surrounding environment has been raised aiming at the enormous infected animal carcass burials. On behalf of the Ministry of Environment (ME) of the Korean government, we conducted groundwater monitoring at approximately 3000 wells around the burial sites for 7 years from 2011 to 2017. The baseline groundwater already had enriched levels of nitrogen and chloride compounds masking the influence of leachate with the pre-existing anthropogenic contamination. Based on the trend analysis, most monitoring wells had no significant trends in NO 3-N and Cl implying that an abrupt degradation in water quality was not expected across the country. Increasing proportions of total coliform detection in the groundwater of the majority of provinces will cause potential damage to human health around the carcass burial sites. Wells showing frequent upward and downward trends near the carcass burial pits were targeted for principal component analysis (PCA) and the results showed that NH 4-N, TOC, Cl, and K could be indicators distinguishing the sole impacts of animal leachate on the groundwater. Analyses of the nationwide monitoring data indicated possibly delayed and prolonged impacts of the widespread burials of livestock mortalities on the groundwater environment. The finding provides realistic insight regarding how to manage the mass burial of livestock mortalities to protect groundwater resources.","Acknowledgements

Two programmes of UK government-funded research were commissioned in the 1990s to investigate the transfer of PTEs to the food chain via ingestion by sheep grazing biosolids-amended soil. Here, we critically reexamine this evidence in the light of other published work and current food quality standards. This was particularly motivated by the need to determine the safety of biosolids controls on PTEs in relation to revised and stricter European food quality controls for PTEs in foodstuffs. The major pathway for transfer of PTEs to grazing livestock is via direct ingestion of biosolids or biosolidsamended soil from the soil surface. The main elements of concern for the human diet are cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), with Cd being the focus of the current paper. Animal ingestion of plant tissue is also a potential pathway for Cd exposure, which, unlike Pb, can transfer to crop tissues. The concentrations of Cd in the muscle tissue of sheep grazing biosolids-amended soil were generally small and similar to control values. Cadmium concentrations in sheep offal were below the maximum permitted concentration for human consumption. This was despite ingestion of soils exceeding the maximum permissible concentration for Cd in soil (3 mg kg −1 dry soil) by up to three times, at an ingestion rate of 10% total dietary dry matter intake. Grazing trials under practical conditions on high Cd soils demonstrated that the Cd concentrations in sheep offal remained below the food limit value for this element in offal from the combined intakes from biosolids-amended soil and herbage. Futhermore, given the substantial fall in environmental emissions and concentrations in biosolids of this element and, consequently, it cannot accumulate in soil to the limit value, biosolids Cd does not represent an issue for the safety of animal meat products.","Acknowledgments

These impacts or side-effects can be positive or negative. Both pathways were designed to meet a sector specific methane emission reduction target of 33 % in 2030 (relative to 2005). The qualitative assessment with stakeholders resulted in developing off-model quantifications to better reflect expected changes in system dynamics and development of more realistic transition pathways used for macro-econometric (E3ME) and atmospheric (TM5-FASST) modelling. We found that each low-emission transition pathway has a unique footprint of positive and negative impacts. This footprint is largely shaped by the combination of existing and new technologies, infrastructure used, and practices deployed. We consider the analysis and results relevant for climate policy and governance processes where there is a need to develop transition pathways that are optimised to meet different sustainable development goals.","Acknowledgements

It is, however, increasingly acknowledged that livestock can contribute to nutrition security if they upcycle low-opportunity-cost feed (LCF) e food waste, food processing by-products and grass resources e into nutritious animal-source food. So far, however, no study explored the allocation question ""to which livestock should we feed what LCF to maximise livestock's contribution to human nutrition"". Here we optimise the use of the LCF available in the EU, using a model that assigns LCF to those livestock systems that maximise animal protein production. We included the five most common livestock systems in the EU e pigs, laying hens, broilers, dairy cattle and beef cattle e considering their nutrient requirements under three productivity levels (low, mid and high). LCF availability is based on current food supply combined with food wastage and food processing data, and current grassland productivity. Our results showed that optimal conversion of LCF available in the EU, could supply 31 g animal protein per EU capita per day. We confirmed that this optimal conversion requires a variety of both livestock systems and productivity levels. Dominant livestock systems were those that have a high conversion efficiency (laying hens, dairy cattle), were best able to valorise specific LCF (dairy cattle for grass; pigs for food waste), and could valorise low quality LCF because of their low productivity. Limiting the model to use only conventional, high productive, livestock reduced animal protein supply by 16% to 26 g/(cap*d). Besides the efficiency with which livestock used the available LCF, the estimated protein supply from livestock fed solely on LCF, was sensitive to assumptions regarding the availability and quality of LCF, especially grass resources. Our model provides valuable insights into how livestock can efficiently use LCF, which is essential for a transition towards a circular food system.","Acknowledgments

Therefore, biofuel production from animal waste has been projected as the solution for animal waste management along with the potential of a new source of renewable energy. This study aimed to evaluate the production of biogas from the farm wastes in Bangladesh and presented the potential biological applications for processing the wastes to convert into biogas. The study demonstrated that the highest amount of livestock waste, approximately 229 million ton was produced in 2016 and it was accounted for a total biogas production potential of 16988.97 million m 3 which could be converted into 16.68 Â 10 7 MWh of electricity. This study also presented the suitable conversion technologies as well as mechanisms of biogas production from animal waste and related mathematical equations to calculate the amount of total biogas productions. The latest advancements in large scale biogas production via government and non-government organizations have also been documented in this work. Besides biogas production analysis, this study also demonstrated the environmental impacts of biogas application. A net CO 2 emission reduction of 4.42 million tons could have been achieved over the diesel power generation along with 29 million ton of biofertilizer. The study also proposed a management plan to improve the current waste removal situation in Bangladesh. Along with that, this review comprehensively outlined the worldwide scenario of biogas production and applications.","Acknowledgment

A countrywide, comprehensive assessment of the quantity and distribution of livestock excrement (LE) production could significantly promote contamination control methods and biogas development in China. Previous researchers have reported an excessively wide range of LE quantities and have failed to reach a consensus conclusion. By using the latest updated LE definitions and calculation coefficients, LE and its biogas potential were assessed for 14 types of livestock in this study according to China's husbandry statistics data. LE increased by 10.9% from 1563.2 Mt in 2007 to 1755.0 Mt in 2015 at a rate of 12.3% in fresh weight and increased by 12.8% from 367.1 Mt to 414.5 Mt in dry weight. The mean annual LE from 2013 to 2015 was estimated on a dry weight basis as 414.9 Mt. Most of the LE produced from 2013 to 2015 was by cattle (including draft cattle, beef cattle, and dairy cows), followed by sheep (including goats), poultry (including broiler chickens, egg chickens, ducks, and geese), pigs, and other livestock (including horses, donkeys, mules, camels, and rabbits). Among the six regions, from 2013 to 2015, the LE was distributed in ascending order in the Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, North, Central-south, and East regions on a dry weight basis. The average LE produced among the 31 provinces in China ranged widely from just 0.8 Mt (Shanghai) up to 42.4 Mt (Shandong), with the latter having the highest LE density distribution (275.7 t km-2) on a dry weight basis. The east-middle provinces, Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Anhui, exhibited relatively higher levels of LE density distribution (111.2e275.7 t km-2) than those of other regions. The yearly total LE generated from commercial scale husbandry feedlots (CSHF) for 2015 was estimated at 141.5 Mt, which amounts to a biogas potential of 60.6 billion m 3 (Billion refers 1 Â 10 9). Scenario analysis predicts that by 2030, the annual LE from CSHF could range from 201.1 to 258.9 Mt, corresponding to biogas potential of 86e111 billion m 3. The results of this countrywide study suggest that there are significant opportunities to improve LE management and to achieve ecological livestock husbandry in China.","Acknowledgments

Thus, the land sector plays a crucial role in the context of climate change, being both a contributor to the problem and part of its solution, particularly thanks to the capacity of soils and biomass to sequester atmospheric carbon. The challenge of this paper is to understand the extent to which sustainable land management can be a valuable solution for increasing the mitigation potential of the land sector, particularly at small-scale rural landscape level. The paper presents and tests a land-based approach to be applied at small-scale rural landscape level, aiming at reducing and offsetting GHG emissions from the livestock activities, one of the main sources of GHG emissions of the whole agricultural sector. The proposed land-based approach builds on an ensemble of methodologies, including Geographic Information System (GIS) elaboration, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and methodologies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that allow estimating livestock GHG emissions and the mitigation potential of sustainable land-use options applied in the same small-scale rural landscape. Results from a case study in Italy show that land-based mitigation options applied at small-scale rural landscape level can reduce and completely offset the GHG livestock emissions of the same area, leading to carbon neutral livestock systems. Thus, this study confirms that the land sector can strongly contribute to climate change mitigation if sustainable land-use options are applied.","Acknowledgments

Based on the perspective of the circular industrial chain, the stakeholders of enterprises, governments, and consumers in the resource treatment of livestock and poultry wastes are incorporated into an evolutionary game system to explore the interaction results between network cooperation subjects in the circular economy. This provides scientific management policy support for the stable operation of the circular model and the realization of livestock and poultry pollution control. We examine the mutual influence of the behavior and the game stability strategy of enterprises, governments, and consumers on the circular economy, and explore the stable operation of the model to achieve pollution control. Under certain conditions, the evolutionary stability strategy of the behavior game is composed of four pure strategy combinations. Among them, the optimal evolutionary stability strategy indicates that the government does not regulate the circular economy, and that enterprises and consumers support the circular economy. With this behavioral strategy, the circular economy can help contain the pollution control of livestock and poultry. Achieving pollution control by a circular economy depends on a market mechanism, which affects the cost-effectiveness of the circular model through price mechanisms. The price of the resource product affects consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn dictates how enterprises adopt the circular economy model. The carbon trading price affects the benefit of carbon emission reduction, and the price of raw materials and equipment affect the implementation cost of the model.",

The reuse of food losses as sustainable ingredients for feed formulations could represent a promising alternative to cereal grains for both monogastrics and ruminants, increasing livestock sustainability and reducing the competition between animal and human nutrition. The acceptance of food leftover for feeding animals it is still far to be completely welcomed in several countries, where the outdated stereotypical image of the garbage used as feed is still existing. To implement this practice, a renewed image of food leftover as feed is needed, mainly disseminating the most recent findings about their properties, the new technologies applied for their production and their impact on the environment. This paper aims to disseminate a wide understanding of food losses and explores the potential benefits of using two main categories of food leftovers, namely former food products (FFPs) and bakery by-products (BBPs), as alternative feed ingredients in pig and ruminant nutrition. Several characteristics of those two categories of food losses are examined and compared to a standard diet, such as nutritional-related properties, safety, efficiency and environmental implications. The literature shows that both categories of food leftovers hold a significant nutritional value and are a sustainable alternative to traditional feed ingredients. They resulted as a low risk category for animal health. In addition, when used in complete feed to replace traditional feed ingredients, neither FFPs nor BBPs do not decrease animal's growth performances. These findings valorize food losses into animal feed as a well-suited strategy to contribute to a reduced environmental and climate footprint of animal products and food waste prevention. However, a greater participation by feed/food processors and stakeholders is crucial to allow the sector to increase its contribution in the entire EU food and feed chain.","Acknowledgements

In this paper, analytical and numerical methods are used to evaluate the energy efficiency and the mitigation capability of the hydraulic cooling system. Results show that annual primary energy use of only 6.08 kWh per animal can reduce 5.87 kg of ammonia per animal per year. The system is most efficient for manure with less than 12% total solids content. Results also show that the liquid region above the cooling pipes features onedimensional transient heat transfer formed by unique flow patterns. A simplified analytical model is derived to predict the surface temperature of liquid manure. The analytical solution shows that the manure surface temperature can be reduced by 7.4 and 12 C after 2 and 5 h, respectively. The temperature reduction results in up to 37.3% decrease in ammonia emissions with only 0.8% of the total energy use in livestock buildings.","Author contribution

The global production of fertilisers, in addition to declining worldwide phosphorus reserves may find it difficult to sustain this rising demand at current capacities. As part of sustainable development, farmers will have to adopt alternative resources that balance the environment, economy and society. Wastewater reuse represents an opportunity for this challenge as it can alleviate the stress on scarce water resources and contribute to circular economies. In addition, it contains relatively high amounts of nutrients that can substitute for part of the fertilisation requirements. In the literature, reusing wastewater for agricultural purposes obtained relatively high acceptance rates amongst populations, especially for growing forage crops. This review gathers all the studies that have investigated the reuse of wastewater in growing animal feed. It details the findings based on the social, environmental, and eonomic dimensions of sustainability. This review provides a basis for future fertigation systems as it gathers all the tools required to make a comprehensive assessment of the practice. Interesting research directions include the need to investigate farmers' concern about consumers' attitude, which apparently obstructs them from adopting new technologies despite their improved harvests. In addition, it is worth investigating the overall environmental benefits associated with wastewater fertigation on the water-soil and on the water-energy nexus, in terms of global warming potential as reported carbon footprint savings in the literature are undervalued. Finally, there is a strong economic potential associated with the practice in terms of industrial symbiosis that requires further exploration.","Acknowledgment

This can be managed. It is a global initiative to increase productivity of the livestock sector to meet a growing population, but with emphasis on decreasing enteric methane to achieve emissions targets. We investigated the marine red macroalga (seaweed) Asparagopsis taxiformis as a feed ingredient to fundamentally eliminate enteric methane in beef cattle fed a high grain diet and provide evidence of improved livestock production performance. Asparagopsis was included in the feed of Brahman-Angus cross steers at 0.00%, 0.05%, 0.10%, and 0.20% of feed organic matter. Emissions were monitored in respiration chambers fortnightly over 90 d of treatment, steers were weighed weekly prior to feeding, feed intake monitored daily, rumen fluid samples collected in conjunction with respiration chambers for assessment of rumen function, feces were collected for bromoform residue analysis, and meat, organ, and fat were collected post slaughter for residue analysis and sensory evaluation. Steers receiving 0.10% and 0.20% Asparagopsis demonstrated decreased methane up to 40% and 98%, and demonstrated weight gain improvements of 53% and 42%, respectively. There was no negative effect on daily feed intake, feed conversion efficiencies, or rumen function, and no residues or changes in meat eating quality were detected. Commercial production of Asparagopsis could create new economies, and with low inclusion rates of this seaweed in ruminant diets the industry has the potential to revolutionize management of greenhouse gas emissions across the ruminant livestock sector with complementary benefits to the environment, and economy of the wider agriculture sector.","Acknowledgements

While intensive production operations are the major sources, small livestock breeding units (diffuse livestock production) potentially also contribute to water quality impairments because of their dispersed nature and lack of appropriate waste treatment facilities. However, little is known about how diffuse livestock production affects the surface water quality due to the difficulty isolating its influence from other agricultural activities. In this study, the fate of diffuse livestock-derived N transported through the watershed (i.e., both amount and flow path by which diffuse livestock-derived nitrogen is delivered to the watershed mouth) across flow conditions was investigated by using a new approach that accounted for aquatic nitrogen retention during transport. Its contribution to watershed nitrogen export was also unraveled and isolated from other sources. Overall percentage of diffuse livestock-derived nitrogen that was transported to surface waters was 8.7%, 58.2% of which was delivered to the receiving water bodies (i.e., the watershed mouth). The fate of diffuse livestock-derived nitrogen that was loaded to surface waters (7.6e8.0% under baseflow, and 10.8e16.4% under stormflow) and exported to the watershed mouth differed across flow regimes (3.9e4.4% under baseflow, and 7.4e12.1% under stormflow). Further, majority of livestock nitrogen was mobilized by the direct discharge of urine (82.2%) due to the farmer's water-flushed operation, whereas, only 17.8% of livestock-derived nitrogen flux was from the loss of manure and urine during storage. The contribution of diffuse livestock to watershed nitrogen flux varied across flow conditions with higher contributions under baseflow conditions (67.9e74.9%) than under stormflow conditions (49.5e54.5%). The diffuse household livestock production can substantially degrade the stream water quality as do concentrated livestock production facilities, which was overlooked in the previous studies. A fully coupled mode that recycles both solid and liquid animal manure should be highly regarded as for the sustainability of livestock production. The findings provide important information for source identification and the management of the diffuse livestock production.","Acknowledgments

While majority of the existing digesters left far behind the expected efficiency, lack of a comprehensive economic assessment along with an efficient design questions their practical application. The present study introduced the first assessment to evaluate the biogas potential from livestock manures and waste from slaughterhouses in Northwest Africa (a case of Mauritania). Using ArcGIS® software, a database was conducted to build maps that show the amount of waste products, the potential of biogas, and equivalent amounts of energy. These were used to assess the potential of biogas and the corresponding potential energy for each geographical department in Mauritania. The results indicated that the southern provinces had the highest biogas potential with the maximum and the average values of 520 and 258.7 (±125.8) Â 10 6 m 3 /year. On the other hand, the lowest biogas production potential (27.7 Â 10 6 m 3 /year) was recorded for northern provinces with the maximum and the average values of 135 and 76.4 (±39.7) Â 10 6 m 3 /year. The results showed that 63,579 Â 10 6 kg of waste associated with livestock (cattle) and slaughterhouse applications were annually produced in the country. It was determined that this quantity could generate 2451 Â 10 6 m 3 of biogas per year, corresponding to an energy potential of 52,704 Â 10 6 MJ/year. Considering the rapid depletion of conventional energy sources and the significance of biogas as a renewable fuel, a detailed feasibility analysis (for the biogas production in each province of Mauritania by means of community type fixed-dome digesters) was also performed in the scope of this study. The results of the comprehensive cost breakdown analysis revealed that the revenues obtained from sale of biogas-generated electricity and digested slurry (as fertilizer) could able to pay the initial investment within approximately 6.5 years without subsidy. The findings of this study, as the first of its own, could be used to comprehend how utilization of information such as slaughterhouse and livestock population, nutrition habitats, land-usage maps and geographic information system (GIS) can be employed to germinate a model for more comprehensive assessment of biogas production potential from livestock manure and slaughterhouse wastes, specifically in case of northern African countries. Moreover, in case of biogas plant, this model could be employed as a decision-making tool to identify the highly qualified location for construction of the biogas plant.","Acknowledgements

The results show that the presence of 500 mg/kg multiwall carbon nanotubes or fullerenes increased the daily and accumulative production of methane (by approximately 46.8% and 33.6%), and decreased the total solid content (by approximately 12.8% and 10.4%) and pH. Exposure 50 mg/kg carbon-based nanomaterials had no impact on digestion. A high-throughput sequencing technique was used to analyze the microbial community diversity and composition in the digests across all treatments. The addition of 500 mg/kg fullerenes and multiwall carbon nanotubes notably altered the composition of the bacteria and archaea at the genus level. The change was particularly evident for Methanobacterium, whose relative abundance was significantly increased (by 67%, 53% and 120% upon with 50 mg/kg fullerenes, 50 and 500 mg/kg multiwall carbon nanotubes treatments, respectively), highlighting the positive effects of carbon-based nanomaterials on microorganisms and the subsequent acceleration of methane production. These findings provide important information on the potential use of carbon-based nanomaterials in methane production via altering or tuning the composition of the bacterial and archaeal communities and have relevance for exploring the use of carbon-based nanomaterials in clean energy and agricultural water recycling.","Acknowledgments

These gases contribute greatly to global warming, environmental degradation and pollution. Livestock production is responsible for 18% CH 4 and 9% CO 2 productions of all greenhouse gases emissions. Methane has a greater global warming effect (about 23 times) more than CO 2. Currently, livestock production faces a great challenge of increasing production to meet global demand for agricultural products and at the same time reduces environmental impact. Many researchers have reported the effects of substituting phytoconstituents such as tannins, saponins and essential oil as chemical feed additives to modify rumen fermentation. These modifications are aimed at reducing loss of feed energy, improving animal productivity and mitigating CH 4 and CO 2 emitted during livestock production. This present review is aimed at providing information on the influence of plant natural products or secondary metabolites (PNP) such as tannins, saponins and essential oils on ruminal microflora and their potentials to mitigate biogases during livestock production. This work will also review purported anti-microbial activities of plant secondary metabolites and its ability to improve animal health and enhance productivity. From the findings of this review, PNP have the potential to improve rumen fermentation, reduce loss of feed energy, improve animal health and productivity, increase animal lifetime performance, and reduce greenhouse gases production-CH 4 and CO 2 during animal production. This review also revealed that supplementation of saponin, tannins or essential oils at low to moderate doses have more potentials and are the promising natural feed additives suitable to manipulate microbial ecosystems, inhibit pathogenic bacteria proliferation in gastrointestinal tract, improve rumen fermentations, mitigate rumen CH 4 production and reduce environmental impact of livestock production. However, further research is required to establish the effective daily doses of plant natural products to animals without any detrimental effect.","Acknowledgements

The integrative benefits contributed by LEs utilization have not been adequately explored especially from life cycle perspective. Due to different levels of husbandry development, LEs utilization in China's provincial regions may present spatial disparity. We construct an integrated assessment model that is capable of elaborating the life cycle energy, environmental and socioeconomic benefits of utilizing LEs from commercial scale husbandry feedlots. The model is applied to 30 provincial regions in China to reveal the spatial features of the benefits. On the national level, the theoretical reserve of LEs shows an increasing trend during 2008 e2017, reaching 200.36 Mt in 2017. 11.30 Mt coal-eq net energy benefits can be generated.

This article characterizes livestock production and evaluates the potential and limitations of organic conversion and the energy efficiency of conventional dual purpose (milk and meat) cattle production in a humid tropical region of Chiapas, Mexico. Our analysis indicates that for the Livestock Production Units (LPU) of the study region, the greater the organic livestock conversion index (OLCI, 0e100%), the lower the values for herd size, stocking rate, total feed supplement, annual cost of feed purchased for cattle, and production cost per cow; by contrast, those LPU with greater OLCI have greater economic efficiency. Furthermore, the greater the OLCI, the greater the values of the following indicators: Feeding management, Sustainable grassland management, Ecological weed control in grasses and crops, Veterinary prevention and care, Food safety, and Ecological farm management. A direct relationship exists between the potential for organic conversion (>OLCI) and energy and economic efficiency. Meanwhile, an inverse relationship was found between OLCI and energy efficiency on the one hand, and-on the other-use of direct and indirect energy, total energy input, energy output, and number of people that could be fed with the energy from milk and meat produced. Converting LPU to organic production and increasing their energy efficiency depends on farmers further developing their abilities to manage sustainable agricultural systems through advisory, technical assistance, and permanent financial support.","Acknowledgements

The region's ruminant livestock sector however, is under scrutiny on environmental grounds due to its large contribution to enteric methane (CH 4) emissions and influence on global climate change. Thus, the identification of effective CH 4 mitigation strategies which do not compromise animal performance is urgently needed, especially in context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) defined in the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to: 1) collate a database of individual sheep, beef and dairy cattle records from enteric CH 4 emission studies conducted in the LAC region, and 2) perform a meta-analysis to identify feasible enteric CH 4 mitigation strategies, which do not compromise animal performance. After outlier's removal, 2745 animal records (65% of the original data) from 103 studies were retained (from 2011 to 2021) in the LAC database. Potential mitigation strategies were classified into three main categories (i.e., animal breeding, dietary, and rumen manipulation) and up to three subcategories, totaling 34 evaluated strategies. A random effects model weighted by inverse variance was used (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3.3.070). Six strategies decreased at least one enteric CH 4 metric and simultaneously increased milk yield (MY; dairy cattle) or average daily gain (ADG; beef cattle and sheep). The breed composition F1 Holstein × Gyr decreased CH 4 emission per MY (CH 4 I Milk) while increasing MY by 99%. Adequate strategies of grazing management under continuous and rotational stocking decreased CH 4 emission per ADG (CH 4 I Gain) by 22 and 35%, while increasing ADG by 22 and 71%, respectively. Increased dietary protein concentration, and increased concentrate level through cottonseed meal inclusion, decreased CH 4 I Milk and CH 4 I Gain by 10 and 20% and increased MY and ADG by 12 and 31%, respectively. Lastly, increased feeding level decreased CH 4 I Gain by 37%, while increasing ADG by 171%. The identified effective mitigation strategies can be adopted by livestock producers according to their specific needs and aid LAC countries in achieving SDG as defined in the Paris Agreement.","Acknowledgements

Our research explores how far these emissions can be reduced by combining field tested mitigation measures for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, and synthetic fertilizers. Many mitigation measures targeting enteric fermentation, manure management, and fertilizer application have been experimentally tested; however, the impact of combining measures is relatively unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we use graph theory to create combinations of measures for which we calculate the overall mitigation potential. From previous review studies, we identified 44 measures and formulated rules on impossible and mandatory combinations of measures. Based on the resulting sets of feasible cliques in the graphs and a simplified technological baseline, we estimate that the combinations with the highest reductions reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from beef cattle by 57%, dairy cattle by 47%, swine by 70%, sheep by 48%, and synthetic fertilizers by 44%. Together, they can reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in the EU28 from meat and dairy production by 54%, and for agriculture overall by 42%. This indicates that implementing more measures in the meat and dairy sectors can create room for further reduction than in the existing modelled pathways for the EU28. However, technical measures are incapable of fully eliminating agricultural CH 4 and N 2 O, so there remains a need for CO 2 removal technologies.","Acknowledgements

Therein, a biorefinery integrated with resource-recovery process which targeting biofuel productivity was designed along with a comparative case study to evaluate system performance considering both environmental and economic aspects. Such integrated system comprised of four objectives: 1) technological pathway optimization to maximize net operating margin (NOM), 2) resource recovery to recycle bioresidue produced from biorefinery, 3) utilization of external biowaste (e.g., livestock manure) to increase efficiency of the energy-recovery process, and 4) an overall evaluation on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The proposed model was applied to a case study in Incheon, South Korea, where has massive microalgae cultivation area. The base case has compared two main upgrading options including conventional transesterification and the emerging technology of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). As per result, HTL has better performance of NOM and GHG emissions with the value of 8982 US$ and 15,567 kg CO 2-eqv , respectively while comparing to transesterification. Ultimately, the subcase that involve with energy-recovery by the utilization of bioresidue and livestock manure (HBOW) has shown great improvement which NOM is increased by 20% while the GHG emissions are reduced by 96%. In short, HTL is economically and environmentally feasible for the biofuel upgrade from microalgae. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out which suggesting HBOW would yield the highest NOM of 14,171 US$ with 40% increase of microalgae amount from the origin, and the NOM would have definite increase with the extra input of livestock manure.","Appendix A.

While a lot of people have adjudged it to be solely a religious and political affair, the reality on the ground that cannot be ignored is the fact that the fight for limited resources has led to this conflict. Countless lives, properties and source of livelihoods have been lost because of the competition for limited natural resources. A cow on average contributes between 70 and 120 kg of methane per year, and Nigeria has 20 million of them. Calling for a boycott of beef and increasing prices of beef and beef-based commodities in this part of the world, because of its contribution to climate change is unrealistic as Nigerians still struggle to meet their dietary protein requirement. It is of paramount importance that the focus of the government and all concerned stakeholders shift from just ending the conflicts in addressing the root cause and putting sustainable structures in place for a lasting solution guaranteeing food security. This paper aims to establish the need for concerted efforts towards addressing climate change in the face of geometrically increasing populations and rapidly decreasing finite resources which have induced conflict between farmers and herdsmen over limited and scarce resources.","acknowledgement

PLF has started being adopted only recently, but the need of technological support on farm is getting more and more important and is facilitating its distribution on farms. A huge number of researches and scientific studies are available in literature about the adoption of technology, sensors and computer tools for almost all reared species. In this literature review, the goal is to study the recent progresses of PLF, and in particular the scientific studies carried out in the last 7 years (2013e2019) on dairy cattle farming. Health, welfare and production aspects were taken into account together with animal behaviour, environmental barn conditions and their effect on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. From the main findings, it can be underlined that PLF brings environmental, economic and social sustainability benefits on farms, but these benefits have not yet been quantified through specific methods for sustainability assessments. Therefore, it is important for near future researches to focus not only on the technological improvements of tools and sensors but also on the aspects of environmental, economic and social sustainability of livestock productions that impact on both farmers and the community and consumers. The role of PLF is more and more important and will support the process of decision-making of farmers, change their role on farm and their management view, and make possible the traceability of products and the control of the quality of products and of the animals living conditions as required from policy-makers and stakeholders.","acknowledgement

Application of natural additives that are suitable for cleaner animal production is a necessity. Yucca schidigera is capable of this and because it could grow in desert area, makes it a potential asset in the face of global warming-related climate changes. Thirty-five studies were used as data, which include in vitro and in vivo evaluations. About 43%, 28.6% and 31% were proportion of ruminant, monogastric and aquaculture species used for this study. Yucca schidigera showed that it is capable of reducing aerial ammonia concentration in pens, and ammonia odour from manure. In ruminant, Yucca could reduce methane emission, lower nitrous oxide emission, reduce urinary and fecal nitrogen. Yucca extract could be used to improve water quality by reducing the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen and nitrate in fresh and marine water used for aquaculture. Therefore, to reduce livestock footprint, Yucca may be included in the diet of cattle, sheep, goat, horses, rabbit, fishes, and shrimps with a positive result. The reviewed publications provide strong support for the use of Yucca extract as feed additive to reduce nutrient excretion and environmental impact of animal-protein production. This study, however, shows that there is need for more in vivo studies of Yucca in swine rabbit, horses and even poultry.",

Treatments consisted of different grazing intensities, defined by target sward heights (10, 20, 30 and 40 cm) of mixed black-oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) pastures under continuous stocking. Grazing management affected herbage utilization and, consequently, animal performance and CH 4 emission. At the individual level, CH 4 emission and animal performance had optimal values when pasture height was managed within a range of 23e30 cm. At the farm level, we found a positive linear effect of grazing intensity on animal live weight gain per hectare and the associated environmental costs of land use. Liveweight gain increased by 90 g ha À1 day À1 and CH 4 emissions increased by 500 g CO 2 eq ha À1 day À1 for each cm of target sward height reduction. Given that most producers graze pastures to very short heights, large-scale adoption of target heights within 23e30 cm in southern Brazil has the potential to achieve 13e14% of the mitigation target for GHG emissions from the whole agricultural sector and 22e25% of the target for enteric fermentation from the livestock sector pledged by the Brazilian Government in the Paris Agreement. We conclude that adequate grazing management is the key strategy to improve animal production and reduce the environmental impact from livestock in ICLS.","Acknowledgements

Exploring novel and effective approaches for reducing ruminant greenhouse gas emissions is essential for cleaner livestock production and alleviating global warming. To investigate the effectiveness of a new feed source, Neolamarckia cadamba leaves (NCL), in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants as well as the underlying mechanism, 0%, 10%, 30%, and 50% NCL were ensiled with corn stalk in two trials. The results indicated that NCL inclusion increased the crude protein content (P < 0.01) and lowered the ammonia-N and fiber contents of the silage (P < 0.01 for both). The silage samples were fermented anaerobically in vitro in buffered rumen fluids at 39 • C. NCL did not affect ruminal fermentation characteristics; however, dry matter degradability was increased (P < 0.05), whereas CH 4 (32.7 vs 27.8 mL/g digestible dry matter [DM]) and CO 2 (132 vs 114 mL/g digestible DM) production were decreased. The microbial composition of the fermentation fluid was analyzed by qPCR and next-generation sequencing. The results showed that NCL inclusion reduced the bacterial and archaeal count (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid, increased the relative abundance of Prevotella and Succiniclasticum (P < 0.05), and decreased that of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Christensenellaceae_R-7 (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that NCL inclusion can be used to restrict proteolysis and increase the nutritive value and digestibility of corn stalk silage. Furthermore, mixing NCL in the feed may represent a dietary manipulation strategy to reduce CH 4 and CO 2 production by ruminants without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation. Consequently, NCL can be recommended for widespread use to achieve a sustainable and cleaner animal production, and for the mitigation of global warming.","acknowledgement

This review aims to identify and compare potentially efficacious technologies and management strategies that reduce nitrogen emissions and improve nitrogen use efficiency along crop-livestock supply chains, with an emphasis on the egg sector. Studies addressing the mitigation of reactive nitrogen emissions at key supply chain stages, including feed input production, feed formulation, and manure management were reviewed. The assessment was based on a combination of environmental, technical and economic criteria. Several priority mitigation options were identified. This included implementation of ""4Rs"" practices and biochar addition to cropland at the feed input production stage, and reduced crude protein diets supplemented with synthetic amino acids or enzymes at the feed formulation stage. For manure management, three substages were considered. Promising strategies identified for these substages were: implementation of mechanical ventilation and bedded systems, along with use of manure belts or scrapers and ammonia scrubbers in poultry housing; covering and adding biochar to manure at the manure storage; and incorporating manure at the land application stage. We also underscore that nitrogen use efficiency efforts should consider all major reactive nitrogen species as well as potential interactions between mitigation options across supply chain stages, while simultaneously considering other potential resources and environmental impacts so as to prevent unintended burden shifting. Towards this end, nitrogen use efficiency initiatives should be supported by detailed life cycle assessment research to elucidate potential interactions, minimize burden-shifting, and maximize systems-level efficacy.","Acknowledgment
